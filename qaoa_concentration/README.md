# Concentration of Measure in QAOA

## Domain
Quantum Algorithms (QAOA)

## The Problem
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading candidate for near-term advantage. A major open mathematical problem is determining the **performance guarantees** of QAOA at low depth ($p$) for general graphs.

## Status
**Open.** It is known that at low depth, the algorithm "sees" only a local view of the graph, which limits its performance (due to "overlap gap properties" or "concentration of measure"). Proving exactly *when* QAOA beats classical algorithms like Goemans-Williamson for specific hard instances is an active open battleground.
