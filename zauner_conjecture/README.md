# Zauner’s Conjecture (Existence of SIC-POVMs)

## Domain
Quantum Information & Foundations

## The Problem
This conjecture asks if there exists a set of $d^2$ quantum states in any $d$-dimensional Hilbert space that are "equiangular"—meaning the overlap (inner product) between any two distinct states is always the same ($1/(d+1)$). These sets are called **SIC-POVMs** (Symmetric Informationally Complete Positive Operator-Valued Measures).

## Implications
SIC-POVMs are "standard" reference frames for quantum mechanics, crucial for quantum tomography (reconstructing a state) and foundational interpretations (like QBism).

## Status
**Open.** They have been found numerically for all dimensions up to 151 and analytically for specific dimensions (like 2, 3, 4, ..., 24, etc.), but a general proof for *all* dimensions $d$ is missing.
