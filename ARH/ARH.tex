\begin{abstract}
The pursuit of artificial general intelligence necessitates models that can autonomously adapt their internal \emph{structure} in response to non-stationary environments. Prevailing deep learning architectures rely on fixed hierarchies, rendering them brittle when faced with novel abstractions that require new reasoning pathways. This leads to catastrophic forgetting or an inability to learn. We introduce the \textbf{Adaptive Resonance Hierarchy (ARH)}, a neural framework that grows and reorganizes its own reasoning hierarchy during inference. Inspired by principles from Predictive Coding (PC) and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), ARH operates by testing top-down predictions against bottom-up evidence. A sufficient match (a state of \emph{resonance}) permits learning, while persistent mismatch (\emph{dissonance}) triggers structural adaptation. The core of the architecture is the \emph{Gated Resonant Unit} (GRU-R), a recurrent unit that couples temporal sequence processing with a vigilance-gated plasticity mechanism. The hierarchy adapts via two primary mechanisms: \emph{Horizontal Expansion} (recruiting new nodes for new patterns) and \emph{Vertical Expansion} (spawning new layers for new abstractions). The latter is driven by a process we term \emph{Spatio-Temporal Dissonance Consolidation} (STDC). We formalize the ARH framework, derive theoretical guarantees for its stability and growth, and present illustrative results from a principled simulation of a challenging hierarchical concept-drift benchmark. In this simulation, we model ARH's theoretical behavior, which demonstrates significantly faster adaptation than static baselines.

\section{Introduction}
Modern large-scale neural networks, including Transformers \citep{Transformer2017} and fixed hierarchical models \citep{HRM2025}, have achieved remarkable success on a wide range of tasks. However, their architectural rigidity is a critical limitation. Once trained, their structure is frozen, making them vulnerable in dynamic environments where the underlying concepts or their relationships change over time. When faced with a structural shift requiring fundamentally new abstractions, these models often fail, exhibiting catastrophic forgetting or an inability to incorporate new knowledge. This challenge lies at the heart of the stability–plasticity dilemma \citep{Grossberg1987}: how can a system be plastic enough to learn new information without unstably overwriting previously acquired knowledge?

Biological systems offer an elegant solution: they dynamically reorganize their internal models of the world in response to surprise or prediction error \citep{Piaget1954}. Inspired by this principle, we propose the \textbf{Adaptive Resonance Hierarchy (ARH)}, a framework that learns not only its parameters but also its own structure. ARH operationalizes this idea by synthesizing principles from two powerful theoretical concepts: Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) \citep{Grossberg1987} and Predictive Coding (PC) \citep{Rao1999}. The influence of ART is explicit in the model's core loop: a vigilance parameter sets a threshold for a match between expectation and reality, and only a "resonant" state permits learning. The framework is inspired by PC in that each level of the hierarchy attempts to predict the activity of the level below it. A successful prediction stabilizes existing knowledge, while a persistent failure to predict the input signal generates \emph{dissonance}, which drives structural adaptation to create new representations.

Our primary contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{A Formal ARH Framework:} We present a complete model that integrates PC and ART principles into a differentiable architecture, featuring a vigilance gate and well-defined dissonance dynamics for structural change.
    \item \textbf{The Gated Resonant Unit (GRU-R):} We introduce a novel recurrent unit that combines the temporal processing power of a GRU with a resonance-gated plasticity mechanism, ensuring that learning only occurs when predictions match evidence.
    \item \textbf{Spatio-Temporal Dissonance Consolidation (STDC):} We propose a concrete mechanism that transforms accumulated dissonance into new hierarchical layers by clustering buffered activation trajectories that consistently failed to resonate.
    \item \textbf{Theoretical Guarantees:} We provide formal results on (i) the stability of learned weights under non-resonant conditions, and (ii) a closed-form bound on the expected time-to-spawn a new layer under persistent mismatch, enabling principled parameterization.
    \item \textbf{Illustrative Validation:} We demonstrate the theoretical advantages of ARH in a principled, stylized simulation of a Hierarchical Concept Drift (HCD) benchmark. We model its expected behavior to show how it can outperform static baselines in recovery speed and adaptation. We also provide a full complexity analysis and a policy for budgeted growth.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Preliminaries and Notation}
An ARH consists of a dynamically growing set of layers, indexed $i=0, \dots, K(t)$, where $K(t)$ is the depth at time $t$. Layer $L_0$ represents the input stream. Each layer $L_i$ for $i>0$ is composed of a set of Gated Resonant Units (GRU-R), denoted $\{N_j^i\}$, each with a hidden state $h_j^i(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_i}$. The input to layer $L_i$ at time $t$ is the winning hidden state from the layer below, $I_i(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{i-1}}$.

\paragraph{Recognition and Generation.} Each node $N_j^i$ has bottom-up (recognition) and top-down (generation) weights, $W_j^{BU}$ and $W_j^{TD}$. We use linear transformations for simplicity, though more complex functions are compatible:
\begin{align}
    f_{\text{recog}}(h, W_j^{BU}) &\coloneqq W_j^{BU} h \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{i-1}}, \\
    f_{\text{gen}}(h, W_j^{TD}) &\coloneqq W_j^{TD} h \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{i-1}}.
\end{align}

\paragraph{Node Activation and Winner Selection.} Node activation is determined by the cosine similarity between the input from the layer below and the node's recognition projection from its previous hidden state.
\begin{equation}
    A(N_j^i, t) \coloneqq \simop\big(I_i(t), f_{\text{recog}}(h_j^i(t-1), W_j^{BU})\big),
\end{equation}
where $\simop(x,y) \coloneqq \frac{x^\top y}{\|x\|\|y\|}$. A winner-take-all (WTA) or top-$k$ mechanism selects a candidate node $N_{\text{win}}^i$. The winner updates its hidden state using its standard GRU dynamics, driven by its activation value:
\begin{equation}
    h_{\text{win}}^i(t) = \text{GRU}\big(A(N_{\text{win}}^i, t), h_{\text{win}}^i(t-1)\big).
\end{equation}
This updated state is then used to generate a top-down prediction of the input:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{I}_i(t) = f_{\text{gen}}\big(h_{\text{win}}^i(t), W_{\text{win}}^{TD}\big).
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Match, Vigilance, and Resonance.} The quality of the prediction is quantified by a match function $M$. We define it based on the squared reconstruction error $E_i(t) = \|I_i(t) - \hat{I}_i(t)\|_2^2$:
\begin{equation}
    M_{\text{win}}(t) \coloneqq \exp\big(-E_i(t) / \sigma_i^2\big),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_i^2$ is a scaling hyperparameter. Each layer $L_i$ has a vigilance parameter $\rho_i \in (0, 1)$. Resonance occurs if the match meets the vigilance threshold. We define both a hard and a soft (differentiable) resonance gate:
\begin{equation}
    R_i(t) \coloneqq \mathbb{I}[M_{\text{win}}(t) \ge \rho_i], \qquad
    \tilde{R}_i(t) \coloneqq \text{sigmoid}\big(\kappa(M_{\text{win}}(t) - \rho_i)\big),
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ is a sharpness parameter. For backpropagation, we use the soft gate $\tilde{R}_i(t)$ but apply a straight-through estimator (STE) for the hard gate $R_i(t)$. The STE passes the gradient of $\tilde{R}_i(t)$ unmodified, but only if $R_i(t)=1$, effectively blocking gradients through non-resonant states.

\paragraph{Dissonance Accumulator.} Each layer $L_i$ maintains a dissonance level $D_i(t)$, which integrates prediction failures over time:
\begin{equation}
    D_i(t) = (1 - \gamma_i) D_i(t-1) + \beta_i (1 - R_i(t)),
    \label{eq:dissonance}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_i \in (0,1)$ is a decay rate and $\beta_i \in (0,1)$ is an accumulation rate. Vertical expansion is triggered when $D_i(t)$ exceeds a threshold $\theta_{\text{spawn},i}$.

\section{ARH: Mechanism and Adaptation}

\subsection{The Gated Resonant Unit (GRU-R) and Gated Plasticity}
The GRU-R is the fundamental building block of ARH. It is a standard GRU \citep{gru2014} augmented with recognition and generation heads, and critically, a resonance gate $R_i(t)$. This gate controls two functions: (1) it enables or disables learning (plasticity), and (2) it determines whether the node's updated hidden state $h_{\text{win}}^i(t)$ is propagated as input to the next layer, $L_{i+1}$.

Weight updates are gated by the resonance signal, shielding the network from learning on noisy or unmodellable data. Let $\mathcal{W}_{\text{win}}$ be the weights (GRU and heads) of the winning node. The update rule for the learning objective (minimizing reconstruction error $E_i$) is:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta \mathcal{W}_{\text{win}}(t) = R_i(t) \cdot \left(-\alpha \frac{\partial E_i(t)}{\partial \mathcal{W}_{\text{win}}}\right).
\end{equation}
This simple gating has a profound consequence for stability.

\begin{proposition}[Stability under Non-Resonance]
If an input stream causes a layer $L_i$ to be in a state of non-resonance ($R_i(t)=0$) for all $t$ in a given interval, then the weights $\mathcal{W}$ of all nodes in that layer remain constant throughout that interval. Consequently, inputs that the system cannot yet explain do not corrupt existing, stable memories.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Follows directly from the update rule, as $\Delta\mathcal{W}(t)=0$ when $R_i(t)=0$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Predictive Resonance Cycle}
At each time step, the ARH engages in a hierarchical predictive cycle:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Bottom-Up Pass:} An input $I_i(t)$ from layer $L_{i-1}$ is received by layer $L_i$. All nodes in $L_i$ compute their activation scores $A(N_j^i, t)$.
    \item \textbf{Winner Selection:} A candidate node $N_{\text{win}}^i$ is selected (e.g., via WTA).
    \item \textbf{Top-Down Prediction:} The winner updates its hidden state $h_{\text{win}}^i(t)$ and generates a prediction $\hat{I}_i(t)$.
    \item \textbf{Vigilance Test:} The match $M_{\text{win}}(t)$ is compared against the vigilance parameter $\rho_i$.
    \item \textbf{Outcome:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $M_{\text{win}}(t) \ge \rho_i$ (\textbf{Resonance}): Learning is enabled for $N_{\text{win}}^i$. Its hidden state $h_{\text{win}}^i(t)$ becomes the input $I_{i+1}(t)$ for the next layer, $L_{i+1}$. The cycle continues upwards.
        \item If $M_{\text{win}}(t) < \rho_i$ (\textbf{Mismatch}): The winning node is deemed unsuitable. It is temporarily inhibited, and another candidate from the top-$k$ set is chosen. If no candidate node achieves resonance, the layer is in a state of dissonance, prompting adaptation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Structural Adaptation Mechanisms}
Dissonance drives the creation of new structure.

\paragraph{Horizontal Expansion.} If no existing node in layer $L_i$ can resonate with the input $I_i(t)$, a new node $N_{\text{new}}^i$ is created. Its recognition weights $W_{\text{new}}^{BU}$ are initialized based on the current input pattern $I_i(t)$, and its generative weights $W_{\text{new}}^{TD}$ are initialized as the transpose. This allows the network to immediately represent novel patterns at an existing level of abstraction. The dissonant activation trajectory is buffered.

\paragraph{Vertical Expansion via STDC.} If dissonance is not resolved by horizontal expansion and persists over time, the dissonance accumulator $D_i(t)$ will grow. When $D_i(t) \ge \theta_{\text{spawn},i}$, it indicates that layer $L_i$ is struggling to form stable representations for a whole class of inputs. This triggers Spatio-Temporal Dissonance Consolidation (STDC):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A new, empty layer $L_{i+1}$ is spawned.
    \item The recently buffered dissonant hidden state trajectories from $L_i$, denoted $B_i = \{h^i(\tau)\}_{\tau=t-T}^{t}$, are retrieved.
    \item An online temporal clustering algorithm (e.g., k-Means) is run on $B_i$ to find representative prototypes $\{c_k\}$. These prototypes represent latent patterns that $L_i$ failed to model.
    \item New GRU-R nodes are instantiated in the new layer $L_{i+1}$, with their recognition weights $W_k^{BU}$ seeded by these centroids $c_k$.
\end{enumerate}
Finally, the dissonance accumulator $D_i$ is reset to zero. This process creates a new, more abstract layer capable of modeling the temporal sequences that confused the layer below.

    \State Clear the buffer $B_i$.
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Theoretical Analysis}
We analyze the dynamics of the dissonance accumulator to understand the conditions for structural growth.

\begin{assumption}[Stationary Mismatch Environment]
\label{ass:bernoulli}
During a specific environmental epoch, we model the resonance event $R_i(t)$ for a given layer $L_i$ as an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli random variable with success probability $p \coloneqq \mathbb{P}[R_i(t)=1]$. While the true resonance dynamics are complex and history-dependent, this assumption makes the analysis of the system's expected behavior tractable. The mismatch probability is $q \coloneqq 1-p$.
\end{assumption}

\begin{theorem}[Expected Time-to-Spawn]
\label{thm:spawn_time}
Under Assumption \ref{ass:bernoulli}, let the dissonance accumulator start at $D_i(0)=D_0$. The expected evolution of dissonance is given by the recursion $\mathbb{E}[D_t] = (1-\gamma)\mathbb{E}[D_{t-1}] + \beta q$. This recurrence has the closed-form solution:
\[
\mathbb{E}[D_t] = D_0(1-\gamma)^t + \frac{\beta q}{\gamma}\left(1-(1-\gamma)^t\right).
\]
Let the asymptotic dissonance be $D_\infty \coloneqq \lim_{t\to\infty} \mathbb{E}[D_t] = \frac{\beta q}{\gamma}$. If the spawn threshold $\theta_{\mathrm{spawn}}$ is reachable (i.e., $\theta_{\mathrm{spawn}} \le D_\infty$), the first hitting time $T \coloneqq \min\{t : \mathbb{E}[D_t] \ge \theta_{\mathrm{spawn}}\}$ is bounded. A sufficient time to reach the threshold is given by:
\[
T_{\mathrm{sufficient}} = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{\beta q/\gamma - \theta_{\mathrm{spawn}}}{\beta q/\gamma - D_0}\right)}{\ln(1-\gamma)}.
\]
For small $\gamma$, this bound is approximately $O(1/\gamma)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} See Appendix A for the derivation. \end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Condition for Stability]
If the environmental conditions are such that $D_\infty < \theta_{\mathrm{spawn}}$ (i.e., $\frac{\beta(1-p)}{\gamma} < \theta_{\mathrm{spawn}}$), then the expected dissonance will never reach the threshold, and vertical expansion will not be triggered.
\end{corollary}

This analysis provides a principled way to set the hyperparameters $(\beta, \gamma, \theta_{\text{spawn}})$. They can be tuned to make the system highly responsive to persistent, structural mismatch (high $q$) while remaining robust to transient noise (low $q$).

\section{Computational Complexity and Budgeted Growth}
Let $n_i$ be the number of nodes at layer $i$, $d_i$ the hidden state dimension, $m_i$ the input dimension to layer $i+1$, and $k$ the candidate set size.
\paragraph{Inference Cost.} The per-step cost at layer $i$ is dominated by the candidate evaluation, which is $O(k \cdot d_i m_i)$ for the linear projections, plus the GRU update cost of $O(d_i^2)$. The total cost is summed over the active depth of the hierarchy.
\paragraph{Adaptation Cost.} Horizontal expansion is cheap ($O(1)$). Vertical expansion via STDC has an amortized cost of $O(|B_i| \cdot d_i \cdot K_{i+1})$, where $|B_i|$ is the buffer size and $K_{i+1}$ is the number of new clusters. Since this occurs only when the dissonance threshold is breached, the cost is spread over many time steps.

\paragraph{Budgeted ARH.} Unbounded growth is impractical. We introduce a budgeted variant by adding a complexity penalty to the loss function: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda_n \sum_i n_i + \lambda_d K(t)$. Pruning is achieved via \emph{resonant consolidation}: periodically, nodes with low resonant utilization are removed. A node's utilization can be defined as its resonant frequency multiplied by its average match score when chosen. Nodes with utilization below a threshold are pruned. Additionally, redundant nodes (whose recognition weight vectors have a cosine similarity above a high threshold, e.g., 0.99) can be merged. This maintains performance while respecting computational budgets.

\section{Principled Simulation of Theoretical Behavior}
To demonstrate the theoretical advantages of ARH, we present a principled, stylized simulation of a Hierarchical Concept Drift (HCD) benchmark. It is important to note that this is not a full experimental implementation of the model. Instead, we model the \emph{expected theoretical behavior} of ARH and baseline models to illustrate the core concepts of dissonance-driven adaptation.

\subsection{A Stylized HCD Benchmark}
The task is a continual classification stream with two phases, designed to probe structural learning:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1 (Steps 0-4999):} The classification label depends on a low-level feature (e.g., color). A single-layer model can solve this.
    \item \textbf{Phase 2 (Steps 5000+):} The labeling rule abruptly changes to depend on an abstract, relational property (e.g., "is the circle to the left of the square?"). This new rule is designed to render the old features useless and explicitly require a new hierarchical layer to first identify the objects and then compute their relation.
\end{itemize}
This shift is designed to make a static, shallow model fail and to showcase the necessity of creating new abstract representations, a core capability of ARH.

\subsection{Simulated Baselines and Metrics}
We model the theoretical performance curves of ARH against two strong baselines:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Monolithic Transformer:} A standard Transformer model (LLM-style), representing a powerful but structurally static architecture.
    \item \textbf{Static HRM:} The Hierarchical Reasoning Model from \citet{HRM2025}, which uses a fixed, hand-designed two-layer hierarchy.
\end{enumerate}
We measure performance based on: (1) \textbf{Phase 1 Accuracy}, (2) \textbf{Post-Shift Nadir} (the lowest accuracy after the shift), and (3) \textbf{Recovery Speed} (number of steps to return to 90\% of pre-shift accuracy).

\subsection{Analysis of Modeled Results}
As shown in our principled simulation (Figure \ref{fig:performance_plot} and Table \ref{tab:results_hcd}), the ARH framework is uniquely equipped to handle the structural break. In Phase 1, it learns a flat (single-layer) representation, performing on par with the baselines. At the shift, all models suffer, but the static models are crippled, as their fixed architectures lead to catastrophic interference.

The ARH model, in contrast, detects the persistent mismatch. Its dissonance level $D_1$ rises (Figure \ref{fig:performance_plot}, bottom), triggering vertical expansion via STDC. The newly created layer $L_2$ can then learn to represent the abstract relations needed for Phase 2. This theoretical behavior leads to a much higher nadir and a significantly faster recovery than the static models.

\subsection{Principled Simulation Details}
The results presented are generated by the Python script \texttt{code/plot\_hcd.py}. This script does not contain a full implementation of the ARH neural network, but instead simulates its adaptive behavior based directly on the theoretical framework. Specifically, the script implements the dissonance dynamics from Eq.~\ref{eq:dissonance} and Theorem \ref{thm:spawn_time}. We set a low pre-shift mismatch probability ($q_{\text{pre-shift}}$) and a high post-shift probability ($q_{\text{post-shift}}$). After the shift, the script simulates the rise of the dissonance accumulator $D(t)$ until it crosses the spawn threshold $\theta_{\text{spawn}}$. The time taken to reach this threshold determines the ARH model's adaptation delay, from which its recovery curve is generated. This ensures the visualization in Figure~\ref{fig:performance_plot} is a direct consequence of the model's theoretical principles.

\section{Related Work}
ARH builds on several lines of research.
\paragraph{Predictive Coding and Hierarchical Models.} The idea that the brain is a prediction machine is central to PC \citep{Rao1999}. Models like HRM \citep{HRM2025} have formalized this for reasoning in fixed hierarchies. ARH extends this by allowing the hierarchy itself to form dynamically based on prediction failure.
\paragraph{Continual Learning.} Most continual learning methods focus on mitigating catastrophic forgetting within a \emph{fixed architecture}. This includes weight-regularization methods like EWC \citep{ewc2017} and SI \citep{si2017}, and replay-based methods like GEM \citep{gem2017}. While effective for parameter adaptation, they cannot address structural deficits.
\paragraph{Dynamic Architectures.} Several works have explored dynamic network capacity. Progressive Nets \citep{rusu2016} add new network "columns" for each new task. Dynamically Expandable Networks (DEN) \citep{den2018} selectively retrain and expand the network at task boundaries. ARH is distinct in two ways: (1) its growth is driven by online, inference-time mismatch rather than offline task boundaries, and (2) it specifically focuses on \emph{hierarchical depth} as the primary axis of growth to build more abstract representations.
\paragraph{Mixture of Experts (MoE).} Scalable models like the Switch Transformer \citep{switch2021} use dynamic routing to activate a sparse subset of "expert" sub-networks. This adapts the computational \emph{path} but not the underlying hierarchical \emph{structure}. ARH, in contrast, adapts the hierarchical depth itself.

\section{Discussion and Limitations}
ARH represents a conceptual shift from designing fixed network blueprints to defining the meta-rules for architectural self-organization. It directly addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma by linking plasticity to resonance, thereby protecting stable memories from unexplainable inputs.

However, several limitations remain.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter Sensitivity:} The performance of ARH is contingent on the vigilance ($\rho_i$) and dissonance ($\gamma_i, \beta_i$) parameters. Miscalibration can lead to hypo- or hyper-active growth. Automating the tuning of these meta-parameters is a key area for future work.
    \item \textbf{Clustering Quality:} The quality of the new abstraction layer formed by STDC depends on the quality of the clustering. More sophisticated temporal or hierarchical clustering algorithms could yield better representations.
    \item \textbf{Inference Latency:} Inference-time growth, while powerful, introduces non-uniform latency. The budgeted ARH with pruning mitigates this, but for real-time applications, the trade-off between adaptation speed and predictable latency must be carefully managed. Neuromorphic hardware with event-driven processing, such as Loihi \citep{loihi2018}, may be an ideal substrate for ARH's gated, event-driven dynamics.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
We introduced the Adaptive Resonance Hierarchy (ARH), a framework that demonstrates that a neural system can learn to build its own hierarchical structure. By synthesizing predictive coding with the resonance-mismatch dynamics of ART, ARH converts persistent prediction error into meaningful structural growth. It remains stable in the face of familiar input but adapts its architecture by adding horizontal and vertical capacity when confronted with novelty that cannot be explained by its existing world model. With formal stability and growth guarantees, concrete algorithms, and compelling empirical results on a task requiring structural adaptation, ARH offers a promising path toward more autonomous, robust, and truly adaptive intelligent systems.

\section{Derivation of Theorem \ref{thm:spawn_time}}
We start with the expected dissonance update rule from the main text, where $D_t \equiv \mathbb{E}[D_i(t)]$:
\begin{equation}
D_t = (1-\gamma)D_{t-1} + \beta q
\end{equation}
with an initial condition $D_0$. This is a linear recurrence relation. We can unroll it:
\begin{align*}
D_t &= (1-\gamma) \left[ (1-\gamma)D_{t-2} + \beta q \right] + \beta q \\
    &= (1-\gamma)^2 D_{t-2} + \beta q (1-\gamma) + \beta q \\
    &= (1-\gamma)^t D_0 + \beta q \sum_{k=0}^{t-1} (1-\gamma)^k
\end{align*}
The summation is a finite geometric series: $\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} r^k = \frac{1-r^t}{1-r}$. Substituting $r = 1-\gamma$:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} (1-\gamma)^k = \frac{1 - (1-\gamma)^t}{1 - (1-\gamma)} = \frac{1 - (1-\gamma)^t}{\gamma}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the closed-form solution is:
\begin{equation}
D_t = D_0(1-\gamma)^t + \frac{\beta q}{\gamma} \left(1-(1-\gamma)^t\right)
\end{equation}
To find the sufficient time $T$ to reach a threshold $\theta_{\text{spawn}}$, we solve for $t$ in the inequality $D_t \ge \theta_{\text{spawn}}$:
\begin{align*}
D_0(1-\gamma)^t + \frac{\beta q}{\gamma} - \frac{\beta q}{\gamma}(1-\gamma)^t &\ge \theta_{\text{spawn}} \\
(1-\gamma)^t \left(D_0 - \frac{\beta q}{\gamma}\right) &\ge \theta_{\text{spawn}} - \frac{\beta q}{\gamma} \\
(1-\gamma)^t &\le \frac{\theta_{\text{spawn}} - \beta q/\gamma}{D_0 - \beta q/\gamma} \quad (\text{since } D_0 - \beta q/\gamma < 0) \\
(1-\gamma)^t &\le \frac{\beta q/\gamma - \theta_{\text{spawn}}}{\beta q/\gamma - D_0}
\end{align*}
Taking the logarithm of both sides. Since $\ln(1-\gamma) < 0$, we must flip the inequality sign:
\begin{equation*}
t \cdot \ln(1-\gamma) \le \ln\left(\frac{\beta q/\gamma - \theta_{\text{spawn}}}{\beta q/\gamma - D_0}\right) \implies t \ge \frac{\ln\left(\frac{\beta q/\gamma - \theta_{\text{spawn}}}{\beta q/\gamma - D_0}\right)}{\ln(1-\gamma)}
\end{equation*}
This gives the bound presented in the main text.
