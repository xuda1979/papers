\begin{abstract}
This paper investigates the existence of Non-Positive Partial Transpose (NPT) bound entanglement, a fundamental question in Quantum Information and Foundations regarding entanglement distillability.
\end{abstract}

\section{Domain}
Quantum Information \& Foundations

\section{The Problem}
"Bound entanglement" refers to entangled states from which no pure entanglement can be distilled (they are "black holes" of entanglement). We know "PPT bound entanglement" exists (states that remain positive under partial transpose). The question is: \emph{Does NPT (Non-Positive Partial Transpose) bound entanglement exist?}

\section{Status}
\textbf{Open.} Finding an NPT bound entangled state would significantly alter our understanding of entanglement distillability.
