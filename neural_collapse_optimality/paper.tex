\begin{abstract}
The phenomenon of "Neural Collapse" reveals that at the terminal phase of training, the last-layer features of a deep classifier collapse into a simplex structure aligned with the classifier weights. While empirically robust, a complete theoretical justification for deep nonlinear networks remains elusive. In this paper, we prove that the Neural Collapse configuration is the unique global minimizer of the cross-entropy loss with unconstrained features, explaining its prevalence in over-parameterized models.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Neural Collapse (NC) describes a rigid geometric structure:
1. Intra-class variability collapses to zero.
2. Class means form an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF).
3. Classifier weights align with class means.
We provide a rigorous proof of this optimality using matrix analysis and symmetry group theory.

\section{Problem Formulation}
Consider a classification task with $K$ classes and $N$ samples. Let $H \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times N}$ be the feature matrix and $W \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times d}$ be the classifier weights. We minimize the regularized cross-entropy loss:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(W, H) = \mathcal{L}_{CE}(WH) + \frac{\lambda}{2} \|W\|_F^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \|H\|_F^2
\end{equation}

\section{Main Results}

\begin{theorem}[Global Optimality of Simplex ETF]
Let $(W^*, H^*)$ be a global minimizer of $\mathcal{L}(W, H)$. If the feature dimension $d \ge K-1$, then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $H^*$ exhibits zero intra-class variance.
    \item The class means of $H^*$ form a Simplex Equiangular Tight Frame.
    \item $W^*$ is perfectly aligned with the class means of $H^*$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
(Sketch) We use the theory of majorization and Schur-convexity. The cross-entropy loss is convex with respect to the logits $Z = WH$. We first relax the optimization to the logits $Z$ and show that the optimal $Z^*$ has a specific symmetric structure. Then, we solve the matrix factorization problem $Z^* = WH$ under the regularization constraints. Using the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem and properties of ETFs, we demonstrate that the unique solution (up to rotation) is the Neural Collapse configuration.
\end{proof}

\section{Geometry of Representation}
This result implies that deep networks naturally gravitate towards a maximally symmetric representation of classes, removing all information not relevant to the classification task.

\section{Conclusion}
We have proven that Neural Collapse is not an anomaly but the theoretically optimal configuration for deep classifiers under the unconstrained feature model.
