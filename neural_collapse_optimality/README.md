# Neural Collapse and the Geometry of Representation

This repository contains the research paper "Neural Collapse as the Global Optimizer of Cross-Entropy Loss".

## Abstract
We provide a rigorous proof that the "Neural Collapse" phenomenon—where features collapse to a simplex structure—is the unique global optimizer of the cross-entropy loss function for unconstrained features. We use matrix analysis and unconstrained optimization theory to establish this result.
