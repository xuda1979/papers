\section{Synthesis: Framework for Condition P}
\label{sec:condition-p-proof}
%=============================================================================

We now combine the preceding results into a coherent framework. The key point 
is that \textbf{rigorous} results are confined to finite volume and strong coupling; 
the extension to all $\beta$ involves conditional steps.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white, colframe=orange!75!black, title=\textbf{Scope of This Section}]
\textbf{Rigorous:} The logical chain below is valid \emph{if} each ingredient 
holds. The issue is that several ingredients are only proven for strong coupling 
$\beta < \beta_0$ or in finite volume.

\textbf{Conditional:} Extending to all $\beta$ requires uniform-in-volume bounds 
at weak coupling---this is the core open problem.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{conjecture}[No Phase Transition---Program]
\label{conj:no-phase-transition}
For $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills in dimension $d = 4$, the theory (with Wilson 
action) has no phase transition as a function of $\beta \in (0, \infty)$. 
Specifically:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item The free energy $f(\beta)$ is real-analytic on $(0, \infty)$
\item The correlation length $\xi(\beta) < \infty$ for all $\beta > 0$
\item The string tension $\sigma(\beta) > 0$ for all $\beta > 0$ in infinite volume
\item The mass gap $\Delta(\beta) > 0$ for all $\beta > 0$ in infinite volume
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Note:} For $N \geq 5$, numerical evidence suggests bulk first-order transitions 
at some $\beta_c(N)$; this would require modified actions to avoid.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{proof}[Analysis of the Conjecture]
We analyze the logical chain, marking each step as rigorous or conditional.

\textbf{Step 1: Vortex Tension $\Rightarrow$ Center Symmetry Unbroken (Conditional).}

\textit{Status:} The vortex tension framework (Theorem~\ref{thm:vortex-tension-rigorous}) 
provides a compelling picture, but proving $\sigma_v(\beta) > 0$ for all $\beta$ 
requires the same uniform bounds that are the core open problem.

By this argument, if $\sigma_v(\beta) > 0$ for all $\beta > 0$, then center 
symmetry remains unbroken: $\langle P \rangle = 0$ $\Rightarrow$ confinement.

\textbf{Step 2: GKS + Confinement $\Rightarrow$ String Tension Positive (Partially Rigorous).}

\textit{Status:} The GKS inequality (Theorem~\ref{thm:tropical-gks}) is rigorous. 
The issue is that it gives $\sigma_L(\beta) > 0$ in \emph{finite} volume, but 
the infinite-volume statement $\sigma(\beta) > 0$ requires uniform-in-$L$ control.

For \textbf{strong coupling} $\beta < \beta_0$: $\sigma(\beta) > 0$ is rigorous (cluster expansion).

\textbf{Step 3: String Tension $\Rightarrow$ Mass Gap (Finite Volume Rigorous).}

By the Giles-Teper bound (Theorem~\ref{thm:giles-teper-rigorous}):
\[
\Delta_L(\beta) \geq \frac{2\sqrt{\pi}}{3^{1/4}} \sqrt{\sigma_L(\beta)} > 0
\]

\textit{Status:} This holds rigorously for each finite $L$. The infinite-volume 
statement requires $\sigma(\beta) > 0$ uniformly in $L$.

\textbf{Step 4: Mass Gap $\Rightarrow$ Finite Correlation Length (Definition).}

The mass gap is the inverse correlation length:
\[
\xi(\beta) = 1/\Delta(\beta) < \infty
\]

This is essentially a definition when both quantities exist.

\textbf{Step 5: Finite Correlation Length $\Rightarrow$ Analyticity (Conditional).}

By Dobrushin's theorem, finite correlation length with uniform exponential 
decay implies analyticity. The conditional step is establishing the uniform bound.

\textbf{Step 6: Analyticity $\Rightarrow$ No Phase Transition (Standard).}

Phase transitions are characterized by non-analyticity of $f(\beta)$. This 
implication is standard statistical mechanics.

\textbf{Assessment of Logical Structure:}

The argument is \emph{not circular}, but it is \emph{conditional}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Steps 2, 3 are rigorous in finite volume and at strong coupling
\item Extension to all $\beta$ in infinite volume is the core open problem
\item The framework shows \emph{what needs to be proven}, not that it is proven
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
