 The conflict between unitary quantum evolution and the semi-classical description of black holes is resolved by introducing \emph{Horizon Memory Combs (HMCs)}: non-Markovian channels on the stretched horizon that encode information in multi-time correlations rather than instantaneous microstates. We prove a \emph{Comb Page Theorem}, showing that for generic scramblers the HMC entropy approaches the unitary Page curve with corrections $O(1/S_{\rm BH})$, consistent with both semi-classical dynamics and unitarity. The framework predicts observable signatures in gravitational-wave experiments and soft memory echoes in gravitational-wave ringdowns.

+\noindent\textbf{New in this version.}
+(i) We exhibit a concrete near-horizon Hamiltonian whose dynamics provably generate an \emph{approximate unitary $2$-design} on the stretched-horizon code subspace on the timescale $t_\ast \sim \lambda_L^{-1}\log S_{\rm BH}$; this upgrades the scrambling \textbf{P2/P2$'$} assumption from a hypothesis to a theorem-level statement (Thm.~\ref{thm:tdesign-grav}).
+(ii) We provide a derivation of the HMC memory kernel from a UV spectral representation of bulk quasinormal modes and prove complete positivity/causality of the resulting multi-time process (Prop.~\ref{prop:uv-kernel}), thereby giving a concrete path to \textbf{P0}.
+(iii) We present a \emph{scalable} PT--MPO algorithm with error certificates (Alg.~\ref{alg:ptmpo}) and resource estimates sufficient to resolve the Page curve at system sizes previously out of reach.
+(iv) We design a hierarchical Bayesian stacking pipeline and an optimal comb matched-filter (Alg.~\ref{alg:combfilter}) that raise the near-term detectability of the predicted $O(1/S_{\rm BH})$ effects from ``infeasible'' to ``challenging but realistic'' with third-generation detectors and analogue platforms.
