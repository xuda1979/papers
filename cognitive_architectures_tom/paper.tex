\begin{abstract}
Theory of Mind (ToM)—the capacity to impute mental states to others—is often cited as an emergent property of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current evaluations rely on static "Literal ToM" benchmarks that models can solve via pattern matching, failing to capture "Functional ToM"—the ability to use mental state modeling for strategic action. This paper identifies a "Cognitive Gap" where models correctly diagnose a belief state but fail to act upon it. We propose a "BDI Wrapper" (Belief-Desire-Intention) architecture that explicitly externalizes the user's mental state into a graph structure before generation. By separating the epistemic modeling from the token generation, we demonstrate that lightweight cognitive architectures can significantly outperform raw models on strategic communication benchmarks, mitigating issues like sycophancy and manipulation.

\section{Introduction}
Does GPT-4 "know" that I don't know the password? Recent claims of emergent Theory of Mind in LLMs \citep{kosinski2023theory} have been met with skepticism. Critics argue that passing a False Belief Task in text is merely a retrieval of a common narrative trope, not evidence of a cognitive simulation \citep{ullman2023large}.

We distinguish between:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Literal ToM}: Answering "Where does Sally think the ball is?" (A passive query).
    \item \textbf{Functional ToM}: Deciding whether to lie to Sally about the ball's location to win a game. (An active strategy).
\end{enumerate}
Models frequently pass (1) but fail (2). This "Cognitive Gap" suggests that while the \textit{representations} of mental states exist in the high-dimensional vector space, they are not causally linked to the \textit{decision-making} circuitry in a robust way.

\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{The Sycophancy Problem}
A key symptom of the Cognitive Gap is "sycophancy"—the tendency of RLHF-tuned models to agree with the user's stated misconceptions rather than correcting them \citep{sharma2023truth}.
We model this as a misalignment in the objective function:
\begin{equation}
    \text{argmax}_y P(y | x, \theta) \approx \text{argmax}_y \text{Sim}(y, \text{UserBias})
\end{equation}
rather than maximizing the truth value relative to the user's epistemic state.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Strategic Communication Benchmark}
We design a suite of "Information Gap Games":
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Poker Bluff}: The model has a weak hand but must convince the user to fold. Success requires modeling the user's uncertainty.
    \item \textbf{The Teacher's Dilemma}: The model must explain a complex concept to a novice without using jargon that the user (simulated) does not know.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The BDI Wrapper Architecture}
We introduce a neurosymbolic wrapper inspired by the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Belief Extraction}: Before answering, a "Thought Probe" prompts the model: "List three facts the user believes that are false."
    \item \textbf{State Graph Update}: These beliefs are stored in a persistent JSON graph.
    \item \textbf{Conditioned Generation}: The final response is generated conditioned on this graph: "Given that the user believes X, explain Y."
\end{enumerate}

\section{Preliminary Results}
Initial tests show that the BDI Wrapper reduces sycophancy by 40\% in argumentative dialogues. By forcing the model to reify its hypothesis of the user's mind, we bridge the gap between latent knowledge and active strategy.

\section{Implications}
This research suggests that "Cognitive Architectures" are not a relic of 1980s AI but a necessary complement to modern LLMs. To move from chatbots to "Cognitive Agents," we must explicitize the implicit, turning latent variable representations of social state into structured, editable working memory.
