\begin{abstract}
This paper discusses the Non-Abelian Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP), a key challenge in Quantum Complexity Theory with implications for Graph Isomorphism and lattice problems.
\end{abstract}

\section{Domain}
Quantum Complexity Theory

\section{The Problem}
Shor's algorithm (which factors integers) works because it solves the HSP for \emph{Abelian} (commutative) groups. The \textbf{Non-Abelian HSP} (for groups like the symmetric group $S_n$) remains the key obstacle to finding efficient quantum algorithms for the \textbf{Graph Isomorphism} problem and certain lattice problems used in post-quantum cryptography.

\section{Status}
\textbf{Open.}
