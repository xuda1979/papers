# Non-Abelian Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP)

## Domain
Quantum Complexity Theory

## The Problem
Shor's algorithm (which factors integers) works because it solves the HSP for *Abelian* (commutative) groups. The **Non-Abelian HSP** (for groups like the symmetric group $S_n$) remains the key obstacle to finding efficient quantum algorithms for the **Graph Isomorphism** problem and certain lattice problems used in post-quantum cryptography.

## Status
**Open.**
