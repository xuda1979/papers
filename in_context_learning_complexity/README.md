# Theory of In-Context Learning (ICL)

This repository contains the research paper "Sample Complexity and Contraction Dynamics of In-Context Learning".

## Abstract
We mathematically analyze In-Context Learning, framing it as a meta-learning process implemented via attention. We derive sample complexity bounds, proving how the error decays with the number of prompt examples, and model the attention mechanism as a contraction mapping in function space.
