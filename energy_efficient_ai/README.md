# Energy Efficient AI

This project aims to develop and analyze new algorithms for artificial intelligence that significantly reduce energy consumption during training and inference while maintaining model performance.

## Objective

- Analyze computational efficiency and complexity of existing architectures like Transformers and Mamba.
- Propose a new, mathematically grounded algorithm to replace energy-intensive components.
- Conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantages of the new approach.

## Structure

- `paper.tex`: The LaTeX source code for the research paper.
- `experiments.py`: Python script for running numerical experiments and generating data/plots.
- `references.bib`: Bibliography file.
