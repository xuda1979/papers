# LLM Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to review existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods used to train Large Language Models (LLMs) for improved performance in:
- Mathematics
- Coding
- Logical Reasoning

## Goals
1. **Review**: Analyze current state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PPO, RLHF, Process Supervision).
2. **Propose**: Introduce innovative algorithms to address limitations in current approaches.
3. **Impact**: The proposed algorithms aim to be highly impactful, improving efficiency and generalization.
