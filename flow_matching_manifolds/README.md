# Mathematical Foundations of Flow Matching & Diffusion on Manifolds

This repository contains the research paper "Mathematical Foundations of Flow Matching on Riemannian Manifolds".

## Abstract
We extend the Flow Matching framework to non-Euclidean domains. We construct "Straight-Flow" interpolations based on geodesic paths and prove rigorous error bounds for the generated distributions on Riemannian manifolds, leveraging Optimal Transport theory and Stochastic Analysis.
