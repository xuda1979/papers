"""
Simulation script for AG-inspired quantum error-correcting codes.
(simulation.py)

This module implements a physics‑driven noise model tailored to hollow‑core
fibres (HCF) carrying both quantum and classical channels (Model 2), includes a
first‑order Markov model for temporal correlations, and estimates the
logical block error probability of a CSS code under asymmetric Pauli noise
using Bounded Distance Decoding (BDD).

The model parameters can be adjusted via function arguments. The main entry point,
``run_default_demo``, executes a Monte Carlo simulation for the standard
[[255,33,21]] AG code over a 100 km fibre with 10 dBm co‑propagating
classical power.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Compute the effective classical power after propagation using the specific
   attenuation model defined in the accompanying paper.
2. Compute the mean number of noise photons generated by spontaneous Raman
   scattering (SpRS) and four‑wave mixing (FWM). The phase (Z) error
   probability is derived from this. These are the 'baseline' probabilities.
3. Model amplitude (X) errors as a fixed fraction ``eta_px`` (0.3) of the phase
   error probability.
4. Generate correlated error patterns via a two‑state Markov process. The hidden
   state persists with probability ``correlation_strength`` (rho=0.6). In the
   low-noise state, the error probability is the baseline rate; in the high-noise
   state, the rate doubles. This implementation results in an effective average
   error rate 1.5x higher than the baseline.
5. Repeat over many Monte Carlo trials; record a block failure if X or Z errors
   exceed the code’s correctable threshold ``t`` (BDD assumption).

To execute the demo, run this file directly with Python 3.
