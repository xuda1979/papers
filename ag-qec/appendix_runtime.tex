\paragraph{Runtime environment.}
We record Python, NumPy/SciPy, and CPU model in the CSV header row and in a JSON sidecar at \texttt{data/env.json}. The \texttt{Makefile} ensures \texttt{PYTHONHASHSEED} is set for full determinism.

\paragraph{Complexity metrics.}
Per-block timings are split into BP and OSD components: \texttt{bp\_time\_ms}, \texttt{osd\_time\_ms}, and \texttt{total\_time\_ms}. We further log \texttt{osd\_calls} to quantify how often the rescue path is triggered.

\paragraph{Decoder parameters.}
Unless otherwise stated: $T=100$ iterations, $\lambda=0.5$, OSD order $K=2$, column weights near~3. Stopping criteria: syndrome satisfied or iteration budget exhausted.

\paragraph{Figures.}
If generated, \texttt{figs/ablation.pdf} visualizes BP vs.\ BP+OSD-2 across $(p_X,p_Z,\eta)$; \texttt{figs/complexity.pdf} shows per-block latencies with 95\% Wilson CIs.

\paragraph{Limits.}
Distance lower-bounds are computed up to small $t$ for tractability at $n=255$; importance sampling is left as future work for deeper tails.
