# BQP vs. PH (Polynomial Hierarchy)

## Domain
Quantum Complexity Theory

## The Problem
We know BQP (Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial Time) is the class of problems a quantum computer can solve efficiently. A major open question is whether BQP is contained within the classical Polynomial Hierarchy (PH).

## Implications
If BQP is *not* in PH, it implies quantum computers can solve problems that are structurally outside the "hierarchy" of classical complexity classes generated by P and NP.

## Status
**Open.** There is an oracle separation (meaning in a hypothetical "black box" world, they are different), but proving this in the real world is as hard as the P vs. NP problem.
