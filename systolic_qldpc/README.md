# Systolic Geometry Bounds for High-Dimensional qLDPC Codes

## Overview
This project investigates the application of **Systolic Geometry** and **Geometric Group Theory** to the construction of Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (qLDPC) codes. Specifically, it aims to establish rigorous bounds on the code distance and rate of homological quantum codes defined on high-dimensional manifolds (e.g., hyperbolic manifolds or complex varieties) using generalizations of Gromov's systolic inequality and spectral expansion properties.

## Core Concepts
- **Quantum Error Correction:** Moving beyond Surface Codes towards codes with linear rate and distance.
- **Systolic Geometry:** Studying the size of the smallest non-trivial homological cycles ($Systole$) relative to the manifold's volume.
- **Spectral Geometry:** Utilizing the Cheeger constant and spectral gap of the Laplacian to enforce "systolic freedom" and ensure robust logical qubits.

## Structure
- `paper.tex`: The main research paper formally defining the framework and proving geometric bounds for the proposed codes.
