PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
-------------------
The original ns.tex was a 108-page, 5800+ line document with 35+ sections that
read like a survey paper rather than an innovative research contribution. It
contained:
- Multiple conclusions (at least 3)
- Repetitive exposition of the same concepts
- Extensive philosophical/motivational discussions
- Survey-style review of prior work spanning many pages
- Heuristic arguments without rigorous proofs mixed with rigorous sections
- Many undefined theorem references and duplicate labels

SOLUTION: NEW FOCUSED PAPER (ns_focused.tex)
--------------------------------------------
Created a focused 7-page research paper that presents the core innovation:

STRUCTURE:
1. Introduction (1 page)
   - Problem statement
   - The hyperviscous model and physical motivation
   - Brief prior results (Lions, Katz-Pavlovic)
   - Clear statement of our contribution

2. Main Results (1 page)
   - Theorem 2.1: Global Regularity (the main result)
   - Theorem 2.2: Trilinear Frequency-Localized Estimate (key innovation)
   - Theorem 2.3: Besov A Priori Bound

3. Preliminaries (1 page)
   - Sobolev and Besov spaces (minimal definitions)
   - Littlewood-Paley decomposition
   - Bony paraproduct (essential tool)

4. Proof of Trilinear Estimate (1.5 pages)
   - Complete, rigorous proof
   - Frequency support analysis
   - Low-high, high-low, high-high decomposition

5. Dyadic Energy Analysis (1 page)
   - Dyadic enstrophy evolution
   - Transfer bound theorem

6. Proof of Global Regularity (1 page)
   - Weighted energy functional
   - A priori bounds via Gronwall
   - Continuation criterion
   - Completion of main theorem proof

7. Discussion (0.5 page)
   - Comparison with classical methods
   - Physical interpretation
   - Open problems

8. References (9 focused citations)

KEY INNOVATIONS HIGHLIGHTED:
----------------------------
1. Frequency-localized energy method working shell-by-shell
2. New trilinear estimate controlling nonlinearity at each scale
3. Weighted Besov energy functional for global closure
4. Clear explanation of why alpha >= 5/4 is the threshold

WHAT WAS REMOVED:
-----------------
- All survey/review sections (RG framework, BBGKY hierarchy, statistical limits)
- Multiple "conclusion" sections
- Philosophical discussions about the Clay problem
- Repetitive expositions of the same ideas
- Heuristic arguments without proofs
- Stochastic NS content (separate contribution, could be another paper)
- Direction entropy framework (incomplete, speculative)
- All appendices with "future directions" and "research programs"
- Tables comparing approaches
- Algorithm pseudocode for numerical methods

FILES:
------
- ns.tex           : Original 108-page survey-style document (preserved)
- ns_focused.tex   : NEW 7-page focused innovation paper
- ns_focused.pdf   : Compiled output (7 pages, ~390KB)

COMPILATION:
------------
ns_focused.tex compiles cleanly with pdflatex:
- No errors
- No undefined references
- No missing citations
- Only one minor overfull hbox warning

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
Use ns_focused.tex as the submission version. It presents the same core
mathematical result (global regularity via frequency-localized methods) in a
format appropriate for a top mathematics or applied math journal:
- Clear problem statement
- Precise theorems
- Complete proofs
- Minimal background
- Focused discussion

The original ns.tex can be kept as supplementary material or mined for
additional results (stochastic NS, direction entropy) in follow-up papers.
