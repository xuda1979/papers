# Theoretical Limits of Reasoning (Category Theory)

This repository contains the research paper "Categorical Limits of Reasoning: A No-Go Theorem for Fixed-Depth Transformers".

## Abstract
We apply Category Theory to bound the reasoning capabilities of Transformer models. By modeling the semantic map as a functor, we prove a "No-Go Theorem" showing that fixed-depth Transformers cannot solve certain recursive logical problems (like graph connectivity) regardless of width, necessitating external memory or Chain-of-Thought prompting.
