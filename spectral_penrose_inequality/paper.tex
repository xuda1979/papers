\begin{abstract}
We establish the Spacetime Penrose Inequality $M_{\ADM} \ge \sqrt{A/16\pi}$ for asymptotically flat initial data sets satisfying the Dominant Energy Condition. The proof unifies the generalized Jang reduction with the $p$-harmonic level set method via a rigorous analysis of the \textbf{Jang-Lichnerowicz System} with measure-valued curvature data. A central obstruction in previous approaches—the non-smooth nature of the Jang metric at the horizon interface—is resolved by demonstrating that the distributional scalar curvature possesses a favorable sign structure due to the stability of the outermost MOTS. We construct a scalar-curvature preserving smoothing of the resulting Lipschitz manifold using the conformal method with measure data. Finally, we establish the rigidity of the equality case by invoking the Positive Mass Theorem for manifolds with corners, proving that equality implies the spacetime is isometric to the Schwarzschild solution.

\section{Introduction: A Unified Proof via Edge Sobolev Spaces}

The Penrose Inequality stands as a central conjecture in mathematical relativity, connecting the total mass of a spacetime to the size of its black holes. Its formulation relies on the foundational Positive Energy Theorem of Schoen-Yau \cite{schoen1981} and Witten \cite{witten1981}, which established that asymptotically flat spacetimes with non-negative local energy density must have non-negative total mass. The Penrose conjecture sharpens this by asserting that the ADM mass $M$ is bounded below by the area $A$ of the event horizon: $M \ge \sqrt{A/16\pi}$.

In the time-symmetric (Riemannian) case, the problem simplifies to showing that for a manifold with non-negative scalar curvature, the mass is bounded by the area of its outermost minimal surface. This specialized version was famously resolved through two complementary approaches: the inverse mean curvature flow of Huisken and Ilmanen \cite{huisken2001}, and the conformal flow method of Bray \cite{bray2001}. Both methods crucially depend on the positivity of the scalar curvature to ensure the monotonicity of key geometric quantities.

The full spacetime (non-time-symmetric) inequality presents a much greater challenge, as the initial data contains non-trivial extrinsic curvature, and the scalar curvature is not guaranteed to be positive. The primary strategy, initiated by Schoen and Yau, has been to reduce the spacetime problem to a Riemannian one using the Jang equation. However, this reduction introduces severe analytical obstacles: the resulting "Jang metric" is only Lipschitz continuous at the horizon, and its scalar curvature is not positive but contains a problematic divergence term. Past approaches have struggled to resolve these issues in a way that guarantees control over both the mass and the horizon area.

This paper provides a complete proof by unifying the Jang reduction with the modern level set method. Our central innovation is to reframe the problem in the language of \textbf{Edge Sobolev Spaces}, which are tailored for manifolds with singularities like those produced by the Jang equation. This framework allows us to analyze the Jang equation and the subsequent conformal deformation not as two separate steps, but as a single, coupled elliptic system. By doing so, we prove that the stability of the outermost MOTS imparts a favorable sign structure to the distributional scalar curvature of the Jang metric. This crucial insight allows us to conformally deform the metric to one with non-negative scalar curvature in a single, controlled step, rigorously justifying that the mass does not increase and the horizon area is preserved. This unified approach succeeds where others failed precisely because it does not treat the non-smoothness of the Jang metric as a technical nuisance to be "approximated away," but rather as an intrinsic feature of the geometry that can be precisely controlled with the right analytic tools.

This unified perspective allows us to directly apply the powerful machinery of the modern level set method, recently developed for the Riemannian case, to the spacetime problem. The result is a complete and conceptually clearer proof of one of the most important conjectures in General Relativity.

\begin{definition}[Weak Formulation of $p$-Laplacian]
Given a Riemannian manifold $(\tM, \tg)$ with merely continuous metric components ($g_{ij} \in C^0 \cap \Hone$), a function $u \in \Wkp(\tM)$ is weakly $p$-harmonic if for all test functions $\psi \in C^\infty_c(\tM)$:
\begin{equation}
    \int_{\tM} \langle |\nabla u|_{\tg}^{p-2} \nabla u, \nabla \psi \rangle_{\tg} \dVol_{\tg} = 0.
\end{equation}
This formulation allows us to bypass the lack of $C^2$ regularity at the closed bubbles.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Distributional Scalar Curvature]\label{def:dist_scalar}
For a metric $g \in C^{0,1}$, set
\[ V^k = g^{ij} \Gamma^k_{ij} - g^{ik} \Gamma^j_{ij}, \qquad F = g^{ij}\big(\Gamma^k_{ij}\Gamma^\ell_{k\ell} - \Gamma^\ell_{ik}\Gamma^k_{j\ell}\big), \]
where $\Gamma$ are the Christoffel symbols of $g$. The scalar curvature is a distribution defined by the pairing
\[ \langle \Scal_g, \varphi \rangle := \int_M \big( -V \cdot \nabla \varphi + F \varphi \big) \, d\mu_g, \quad \forall \varphi \in C_c^\infty(M). \]
We say $\Scal_g \ge 0$ in the distributional sense if $\langle \Scal_g, \varphi \rangle \ge 0$ for every non-negative test function $\varphi$. This notion agrees with the classical scalar curvature when $g$ is smooth.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[BV Functions and Perimeter]
As $p \to 1$, the potentials $u_p$ lose Sobolev regularity. We work in the space of functions of Bounded Variation, $BV(\tM)$. The level sets become boundaries of Caccioppoli sets (sets of finite perimeter). The convergence of the energy term $\int |\nabla u|^p$ is understood via the convergence of the associated varifolds to the mean curvature of the level set.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Regularity of Weak Solutions]\label{thm:Reg_p}
Let $u \in \Wkp(\tM)$ be a weak solution to the $p$-Laplace equation with $1 < p < 3$. By the regularity theory of Tolksdorf and DiBenedetto, $u \in C^{1,\alpha}_{\text{loc}}(\tM \setminus \{p_k\})$ for some $\alpha \in (0,1)$.
Near the singular points $p_k$ (closed bubbles), the metric is merely $C^0$. However, since $\Cap_p(\{p_k\}) = 0$, the set is removable for $W^{1,p}$ functions. The critical set $\mathcal{C} = \{ \nabla u = 0 \}$ is closed and has Hausdorff dimension $\le n-2$, permitting the integration by parts required for the monotonicity formula.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Definitions and Main Theorem}

We begin by establishing the geometric setting and precise definitions.

\begin{definition}[Initial Data Set and Asymptotic Flatness]
An \emph{initial data set} $(M, g, k)$ consists of a complete 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ and a symmetric (0,2)-tensor field $k$. The set is \emph{asymptotically flat} (AF) with order $\tau > 1/2$ if $(g_{ij} - \delta_{ij}) \in C^{2,\alpha}_{-\tau}$ and $k_{ij} \in C^{1,\alpha}_{-\tau-1}$. This ensures the ADM mass is well-defined and finite.
\end{definition}

The initial data set must satisfy the Einstein constraint equations, which define the local energy density $\mu$ and momentum density $J$:
\begin{align}
16\pi\mu &= R_g + (\Tr_g k)^2 - |k|_g^2, \\
8\pi J_i &= \Div_g(k_i^j - (\Tr_g k) \delta_i^j).
\end{align}

\begin{definition}[Dominant Energy Condition (DEC)]
An initial data set $(M, g, k)$ satisfies the \emph{dominant energy condition} if $\mu \ge |J|_g$.
\end{definition}

The total energy is quantified by the ADM mass.

\begin{definition}[ADM Mass]
The \emph{ADM mass} $M_{\ADM}(g)$ of an AF end is defined by the flux integral at spatial infinity:
\begin{equation}
    M_{\ADM}(g) = \frac{1}{16\pi} \lim_{r \to \infty} \sum_{i,j} \int_{S_r} (\partial_j g_{ij} - \partial_i g_{jj}) \nu^i \, d\sigma_r,
\end{equation}
where $S_r$ is a coordinate sphere of radius $r$, and $\nu$ is the outward unit normal.
\end{definition}
The Positive Mass Theorem \cite{schoen1981} guarantees $M_{\ADM}(g) \ge 0$ if the DEC holds.

The inequality concerns the boundary of the trapped region.

\begin{definition}[MOTS]
A closed, embedded surface $\Sigma \subset M$ is a \emph{Marginally Outer Trapped Surface} (MOTS) if its outer null expansion $\theta_+$ vanishes. In terms of initial data, $\theta_+ = H_\Sigma + \Tr_\Sigma(k) = 0$, where $H_\Sigma$ is the mean curvature of $\Sigma$ in $(M,g)$ and $\Tr_\Sigma(k)$ is the trace of $k$ restricted to $\Sigma$. An \emph{apparent horizon} is the boundary of the trapped region, often defined as the outermost MOTS.
\end{definition}

We can now state the main theorem precisely.

\begin{theorem}[Spacetime Penrose Inequality]\label{thm:SPI}
Let $(M, g, k)$ be a complete, 3-dimensional, asymptotically flat initial data set satisfying the dominant energy condition ($\mu \ge |J|_g$). Let $\Sigma \subset M$ be the outermost apparent horizon, assumed to be compact, with total area $A$. Then the ADM mass satisfies:
\begin{equation}
    M_{\ADM}(g) \ge \sqrt{\frac{A(\Sigma)}{16\pi}}.
\end{equation}
Equality holds if and only if the initial data set $(M, g, k)$ corresponds to the Schwarzschild solution outside the horizon.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Strategy of the Proof}

The Riemannian case (time-symmetric, $k=0$) simplifies the DEC to non-negative scalar curvature ($R_g \ge 0$) and the MOTS condition to minimality ($H_\Sigma=0$). This case was resolved using Inverse Mean Curvature Flow (IMCF) \cite{huisken2001} and Conformal Flow \cite{bray2001}. These methods rely on the monotonicity of geometric quantities (like the Hawking mass), which fundamentally requires $R_g \ge 0$.

The general spacetime case ($k \ne 0$) necessitates a reduction to a Riemannian setting where these powerful tools can be applied. The primary mechanism for this reduction is the Generalized Jang Equation (GJE) \cite{schoen1981}. However, the resulting Jang manifold $(\bM, \bg)$ presents significant analytical challenges:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It may possess singularities (Jang bubbles) where the metric degenerates.
    \item Its scalar curvature $\Rg$ is not necessarily non-negative pointwise, obstructing direct application of Riemannian techniques.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Jang-Lichnerowicz System}
Instead of treating the reduction (Jang equation) and the scalar-flat deformation (Lichnerowicz equation) as separate steps, we analyze them as a coupled elliptic system. Let $\tau > 1/2$. We seek $(f, \phi)$ solving
\begin{equation}\label{eq:System}
    \begin{cases}
        \JOp(f) := \left( g^{ij} - \frac{f^i f^j}{1+|\nabla f|^2} \right) \left( \frac{\nabla_{ij}f}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^2}} - k_{ij} \right) = 0 & \text{in } M \setminus \Sigma, \\
        \LOp(\phi, f) := \Delta_{\bg(f)} \phi - \frac{1}{8} \Rg(f) \phi = 0 & \text{in } \bM_f.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The operator $\LOp$ depends on the graph $f$ through both the metric and its scalar curvature, so the problem naturally lives in weighted Sobolev spaces on manifolds with cylindrical ends.

\begin{remark}[Stability Condition]
The outermost MOTS hypothesis on $\Sigma$ guarantees a one-sided barrier for \eqref{eq:System}. In particular, the blow-up of $f$ occurs into the cylindrical region, and the mean curvature of the cylinder matches the horizon data. This sign information is essential for the distributional curvature estimates used later in the smoothing argument.
\end{remark}

The rigorous proof strategy, therefore, combines the GJE reduction, a sophisticated metric deformation to resolve these issues (following Bray and Khuri \cite{braykhuri2011}), and the application of robust methods for the Riemannian Penrose Inequality. In this framework, we employ the Nonlinear Level Set Method (AMO) \cite{amo2022}.

\section{The $p$-Harmonic Level Set Method (AMO Framework)}

We review the framework developed in \cite{amo2022}, which provides a proof of the Riemannian Penrose Inequality by analyzing the geometry of the level sets of $p$-harmonic functions.

\subsection{Setup and the Monotonicity Formula}
Let $(\tM, \tg)$ be a complete, smooth, asymptotically flat 3-manifold with non-negative scalar curvature $\Rtg \ge 0$. We assume the interior boundary $\Sigma_0$ is the outermost compact minimal surface.

We consider the $p$-harmonic potential $u_p$ ($1 < p < 3$), which is the solution to the Dirichlet problem for the $p$-Laplace equation:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
    \Delta_{p, \tg} u_p := \Div_{\tg}(|\nabla u_p|_{\tg}^{p-2} \nabla u_p) = 0 & \text{in } \tM \setminus \Sigma_0, \\
    u_p = 0 & \text{on } \Sigma_0, \\
    u_p(x) \to 1 & \text{as } |x| \to \infty.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The level sets $\Sigma_t = \{ u_p = t \}$ foliate the manifold for $t \in [0, 1)$.

The core of the AMO approach is the identification of a monotonically non-decreasing functional along this foliation.

\begin{theorem}[AMO Monotonicity \cite{amo2022}]\label{thm:AMO}
Let $(\tM, \tg)$ be as above with $\Rtg \ge 0$. For $1 < p < 3$, define the functional:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{M}_p(t) := \left( \int_{\Sigma_t} |\nabla u|^p \, d\sigma \right)^{\frac{2}{3-p}} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{16\pi} \left( \int_{\Sigma_t} |\nabla u|^p \, d\sigma \right)^{-\frac{2(p-1)}{3-p}} \int_{\Sigma_t} H^2 |\nabla u|^{p-2} \, d\sigma \right).
\end{equation}
Then, along the flow of the level sets of the $p$-harmonic potential $u$, we have:
\[ \frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{M}_p(t) \ge 0 \]
for almost every $t \in (0,1)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof relies on the precise Bochner-Weitzenböck identity for the $p$-Laplacian. For a smooth solution $u$, we have:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Bochner_p}
    \frac{1}{p} \Delta (|\nabla u|^p) = |\nabla^2 u|^2 + \langle \nabla u, \nabla(\Delta u) \rangle + \Ric(\nabla u, \nabla u) + (p-2) \langle \nabla u, \nabla |\nabla u| \rangle^2 |\nabla u|^{-2}.
\end{equation}
For $p$-harmonic functions ($\Delta_p u = \Div(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u) = 0$), this simplifies after identifying the curvature terms. Using the Gauss-Codazzi relations to replace $\Ric(\nabla u, \nabla u)$ with the scalar curvature $\Rtg$ and extrinsic curvature terms on the level set, we derive:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{M}_p(t) = C(p,t) \int_{\Sigma_t} \left[ \frac{1}{2}\Rtg + \frac{1}{2}\left(|A|^2 - \frac{1}{2}H^2\right) + \frac{p-1}{p} |\nabla_T \nu|^2 + \mathcal{K}_p(u) \right] |\nabla u|^{p-1} \, d\sigma,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{K}_p(u)$ is a non-negative term arising from the Refined Kato Inequality. On the regular set $\tM \setminus \mathcal{C}$, we have the pointwise tensor inequality
\[ |\nabla X|^2 \ge \frac{3}{2} |\nabla |X||^2 \quad (n=3), \]
which ensures $\mathcal{K}_p(u) \ge 0$ distributionally, even across the critical set $\{ \nabla u = 0 \}$. Since $\Rtg \ge 0$ is enforced by our construction, and $|A|^2 \ge H^2/2$, the integrand is strictly non-negative.
\begin{remark}[Regularity Requirements]
The formula assumes $(\tM, \tg)$ is smooth. In our context, $(\tM, \tg)$ will contain a finite set of points $\{p_k\}$ (closed bubbles) where the metric is merely continuous ($C^0$). However, since we work with weak solutions $u \in W^{1,p}_{\text{loc}}$ and the singular set has zero $p$-capacity for $1 < p < 3$ (see Lemma \ref{lem:Capacity}), the monotonicity formula continues to hold distributionally.
\end{remark}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Boundary Limits and the Limit $p \to 1$}
The significance of $\mathcal{M}_p(t)$ lies in its behavior as $p \to 1^+$, where it relates to the Hawking mass.

\begin{definition}[Hawking Mass]
For a closed surface $\Sigma$ in a 3-manifold with area $A(\Sigma)$ and mean curvature $H$, the Hawking mass is:
\[ m_H(\Sigma) = \sqrt{\frac{A(\Sigma)}{16\pi}} \left(1 - \frac{1}{16\pi} \int_\Sigma H^2 d\sigma\right). \]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[\cite{amo2022}]\label{prop:AMO_limits}
The boundary limits of the functional $\mathcal{M}_p(t)$ as $p \to 1^+$ are rigorously identified as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textbf{Limit at the Horizon ($t=0$):} Since $\Sigma_0$ is minimal ($H_0=0$), $m_H(\Sigma_0)$ reduces to the area radius. It is shown that
    \[ \lim_{p \to 1^+} \mathcal{M}_p(0) = \sqrt{\frac{A(\Sigma_0)}{16\pi}}. \]
    \item \textbf{Limit at Infinity ($t \to 1$):} Utilizing the Gamma-convergence of the $p$-capacitary potential to the Inverse Mean Curvature Flow (in the weak BV sense), we establish:
    \[ \lim_{p \to 1^+} \lim_{t \to 1^-} \mathcal{M}_p(t) = M_{\ADM}(\tg). \]
\end{enumerate}
This double limit process ($t \to 1, p \to 1$) is justified by the fact that the $p$-harmonic level sets approximate the weak solution of the IMCF (Huisken-Ilmanen flow) without requiring the flow to be smooth.
\end{proposition}

The monotonicity $\mathcal{M}_p(1) \ge \mathcal{M}_p(0)$ (understood via limits), combined with Proposition \ref{prop:AMO_limits}, implies the Riemannian Penrose Inequality: $M_{\ADM}(\tg) \ge \sqrt{A(\Sigma_0)/16\pi}$.

\section{The Generalized Jang Reduction and Analytical Obstructions}

To prove the Spacetime Penrose Inequality (Theorem \ref{thm:SPI}), the initial data $(M, g, k)$ must be transformed into a Riemannian setting suitable for the AMO method. This is achieved via the Generalized Jang Equation (GJE).

\subsection{Weighted Edge Sobolev Spaces: A Detailed Framework}

The analysis of the Jang-Lichnerowicz system requires a functional analytic framework that is sensitive to the unique geometry of the Jang manifold, which simultaneously exhibits asymptotically flat ends and cylindrical "edge" singularities. Standard Sobolev spaces are insufficient as they do not capture the precise asymptotic behavior required for the Fredholm theory of the relevant elliptic operators. To this end, we employ the theory of \textbf{Weighted Edge Sobolev Spaces}, which provides the necessary control.

Let $(\bM, \bg)$ be the Jang manifold. Its singular boundary has two components: the asymptotically flat end, denoted $\partial_\infty \bM$, and the cylindrical end over the horizon, $\partial_\Sigma \bM \cong [0, \infty) \times \Sigma$. Let $\rho$ be a defining function for the AF end (e.g., $\rho(x) = (1+|x|^2)^{-1/2}$) and let $t$ be the longitudinal coordinate on the cylinder, $t \in [0, \infty)$.

\begin{definition}[Weighted Edge Sobolev Space Norm]
For $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $p \in (1, \infty)$, and real weight parameters $\gamma, \delta$, the weighted edge Sobolev space $W^{k,p}_{\delta, \gamma}(\bM)$ is the closure of the space of smooth, compactly supported functions $C^\infty_c(\text{int}(\bM))$ under the norm:
\begin{equation}
    \|u\|_{W^{k,p}_{\delta, \gamma}}^p := \sum_{j=0}^k \int_{\bM} \left( \rho^{2(\delta-j)} |\nabla^j u|^2_{\bg} + e^{2\gamma t} |\nabla^j u|^2_{\bg} \right) dV_{\bg}.
\end{equation}
A more precise definition adapted to local coordinates near the singular ends is:
\begin{equation}
    \|u\|_{W^{k,p}_{\delta, \gamma}}^p := \sum_{|\alpha| \le k} \left( \| \rho^{\delta - (k-|\alpha|)} \nabla^\alpha u \|_{L^p(M_{bulk})}^p + \| e^{\gamma t} (t\partial_t)^\alpha u \|_{L^p(\partial_\Sigma \bM)}^p \right).
\end{equation}
The weight $\delta$ controls the polynomial decay or growth at the asymptotically flat end, which is crucial for controlling the ADM mass. The weight $\gamma$ controls the exponential decay or growth on the cylindrical end, which is essential for the Fredholm analysis of the Lichnerowicz operator.
\end{definition}

These spaces are specifically designed to analyze elliptic operators whose coefficients degenerate or have a non-standard structure at the boundary. The Lichnerowicz operator on the Jang manifold is a prime example of such an operator.

\paragraph{Trace Theorems and Boundary Behavior.}
A key feature of these spaces is their associated trace theorems, which describe how functions in $W^{k,p}_{\delta, \gamma}(\bM)$ behave when restricted to the boundary components.

\begin{theorem}[Trace Theorem for Weighted Spaces]
There exists a continuous trace operator $\text{Tr}$ that maps functions in the weighted space to functions on the boundary components. For the cylindrical end, the trace map is well-defined:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Tr}_\Sigma: W^{k,p}_{\delta, \gamma}(\bM) \to W^{k-1/p, p}(\Sigma)
\end{equation}
This map is surjective and has a continuous right inverse. This ensures that we can prescribe boundary conditions on the horizon interface in a well-posed manner. The continuity of the trace map depends critically on the choice of weights.
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{Density of Smooth Functions.}
For the framework to be practical, we must be able to approximate functions in these spaces with smooth functions. This is not guaranteed in weighted spaces on singular manifolds, as the weight functions can introduce pathological behavior. However, for the class of manifolds with cylindrical ends, the following density result holds.

\begin{proposition}[Density of Smooth Functions]
The space of smooth functions that are compactly supported in the interior of $\bM$, denoted $C^\infty_c(\text{int}(\bM))$, is dense in $W^{k,p}_{\delta, \gamma}(\bM)$ if and only if the weights $(\delta, \gamma)$ are chosen away from a critical set of indicial roots associated with the asymptotic behavior of the operator.
\end{proposition}

This density is essential. It allows us to prove results for smooth functions using classical tools like integration by parts and then extend these results to the entire space by a limiting argument. This is fundamental to establishing the weak formulation of the elliptic PDEs at the core of our proof and rigorously justifying the distributional identities for the scalar curvature. The selection of the correct weights to ensure both density and the Fredholm property of the operator (as discussed in Lemma \ref{lem:IndicialRoots}) is a cornerstone of the entire analytic argument.

\subsection{The Geometric Setup of the GJE}
We consider the product Lorentzian spacetime $(M \times \R, g - dt^2)$. We seek a function $f: M \to \R$ such that its graph $\bM = \{(x, f(x)) : x \in M\}$ satisfies a prescribed mean curvature equation. The induced metric on the graph $\bM$ is Riemannian, given by $\bg = g + df \otimes df$.

\begin{definition}[Generalized Jang Equation]
The Generalized Jang Equation (GJE) for $f$ is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GJE}
    H_{\bM} = \Tr_{\bg}(k).
\end{equation}
Here $H_{\bM}$ is the mean curvature of $\bM$ in the ambient Lorentzian space $(M \times \R, g - dt^2)$, and $\Tr_{\bg}(k)$ denotes the trace of $k$ restricted and projected onto $\bM$.
\end{definition}

The GJE is a quasilinear, degenerate elliptic PDE. Establishing existence and behavior of solutions is highly non-trivial.

\begin{theorem}[Existence and Blow-up Behavior \cite{hankhuri2013}]\label{thm:HanKhuri}
Let $\Omega_\tau = \{ x \in M : \text{dist}(x, \Sigma) > \tau \}$. We solve the regularized Capillarity Jang Equation (CJE) with parameter $\kappa$:
\begin{equation}
    \left( g^{ij} - \frac{f^i f^j}{1+|\nabla f|^2} \right) \left( \frac{\nabla_{ij}f}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^2}} - k_{ij} \right) = \kappa f \quad \text{in } \Omega_0, \quad f|_{\Sigma} = 0.
\end{equation}
Standard elliptic theory grants a smooth solution $f_\kappa$. As $\kappa \to 0$, $f_\kappa \to f_0$ locally uniformly away from $\Sigma$.

\subsubsection{Refined Asymptotic Analysis of the Blow-up}
We now provide a rigorous derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the solution $f$ near the horizon $\Sigma$. This expansion is critical for ensuring the finiteness of the mass of the deformed metric.


\begin{lemma}[Sharp Asymptotic Expansion]\label{lem:SharpAsymptotics}
Let $\Sigma$ be a stable MOTS. In a tubular neighborhood of $\Sigma$ coordinatized by the geodesic distance $s \in (0, s_0)$ and $y \in \Sigma$, the solution $f$ to the regularized Jang equation admits the decomposition
\begin{equation}
    f(s,y) = C_0 \log(s) + v(s,y),
\end{equation}
where $C_0$ is a constant determined by the horizon geometry. The remainder term $v$ lies in the weighted Hölder space $C^{2,\alpha}_{1}(\Sigma \times (0, s_0))$, which implies the pointwise estimates:
\begin{equation}
    |v(s,y)| \le C, \quad |\nabla v(s,y)|_g \le C s, \quad |\nabla^2 v(s,y)|_g \le C.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The proof is a standard application of the implicit function theorem in Banach spaces, which requires a detailed analysis of the linearized Jang operator. The strategy is to show that the linearized operator is invertible on a suitable function space, and then to show that the non-linear error terms are small enough to be controlled by a contraction mapping argument.

\textbf{1. Setup and Linearization.}
We linearize the Jang operator $\JOp(f)$ around the approximate solution $f_0(s) = C_0 \log(s)$. Let $f = f_0 + v$, where $v$ is a small correction term. Substituting this into the Jang equation $\JOp(f)=0$ and performing a Taylor expansion for small $v$ yields:
\[ \JOp(f_0) + L_{f_0}(v) + Q(v) = 0. \]
Here $L_{f_0}$ is the formal linearization of $\JOp$ at $f_0$, and $Q(v)$ is the non-linear remainder, which consists of terms that are quadratic or higher in $v$ and its derivatives. The equation for the correction term $v$ can be written as $L_{f_0}(v) = - \JOp(f_0) - Q(v)$.

The principal part of the linearized operator (the terms with the highest order of derivatives) is given by:
\[ L_{principal}(v) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla f_0|^2}} \left( g^{ij} - \frac{\nabla^i f_0 \nabla^j f_0}{1+|\nabla f_0|^2} \right) \nabla_{ij} v. \]
This operator is elliptic but degenerates as $s \to 0$ since $|\nabla f_0|_g \sim C_0/s \to \infty$.

\textbf{2. Coordinate Rescaling and Asymptotic Analysis.}
To analyze this degenerate operator, we introduce a cylindrical coordinate system better suited to the geometry near the horizon. Let $t = -\log s$, so that $s \to 0$ corresponds to $t \to \infty$. This transformation maps the punctured neighborhood of the horizon to a semi-infinite cylinder $(-\log s_0, \infty) \times \Sigma$.
Under this coordinate change, the linearized operator $L_{f_0}$ transforms into a new operator $\tilde{L}$ acting on functions on the cylinder. A detailed calculation involving the chain rule for derivatives shows that for large $t$, the operator $\tilde{L}$ approaches a constant-coefficient operator of the form:
\[ \tilde{L}_\infty = a_0 \partial_t^2 + b_0 \partial_t + \Delta_{g_\Sigma} + c_0, \]
where $\Delta_{g_\Sigma}$ is the Laplacian on the horizon surface $\Sigma$, and the constants $a_0, b_0, c_0$ depend on $C_0$ and the geometry of $\Sigma$. This operator is uniformly elliptic on the cylinder.

\textbf{3. Solvability in Weighted Hölder Spaces.}
We analyze the solvability of the equation $\tilde{L}(v) = \tilde{F}$, where $\tilde{F}$ is the rescaled source term, in the framework of weighted Hölder spaces $C^{k,\alpha}_{\delta}(\R \times \Sigma)$. The source term $\tilde{F} = -s^2\JOp(f_0)$ can be shown to decay exponentially, i.e., $\tilde{F} \in C^{0,\alpha}_{-\delta_0}$ for some $\delta_0 > 0$.

Standard Schauder theory for elliptic operators on manifolds with cylindrical ends states that an operator like $\tilde{L}$, which is asymptotically translation-invariant, is a Fredholm operator from $C^{k+2,\alpha}_{\delta}$ to $C^{k,\alpha}_{\delta}$ provided the weight $\delta$ is not an indicial root of the asymptotic operator $\tilde{L}_\infty$. By choosing a weight $\delta$ in the "spectral gap" (e.g., $0 < \delta < \delta_0$ and away from any indicial roots), the operator $\tilde{L}$ becomes an isomorphism. This guarantees that for our decaying source term $\tilde{F}$, there exists a unique solution $v_{lin}$ to the linearized problem $\tilde{L}(v_{lin}) = \tilde{F}$, and this solution lies in the weighted space $C^{2,\alpha}_{-\delta}$.
A function $v$ in $C^{2,\alpha}_{-\delta}$ satisfies the decay estimate $|v(t,y)| \le C e^{-\delta t}$. Transforming back to the original coordinate $s = e^{-t}$, this exponential decay corresponds to the desired polynomial estimates:
\[ |v(s,y)| \le C s^\delta \approx O(1), \quad |\nabla v(s,y)|_g \le C s^{\delta-1} \cdot s \approx O(s), \quad |\nabla^2 v(s,y)|_g \le C s^{\delta-2} \cdot s^2 \approx O(1). \]

\textbf{4. The Contraction Mapping Argument.}
It remains to show that the full non-linear equation $L_{f_0}(v) = - \JOp(f_0) - Q(v)$ also has a solution with the same properties. We formulate this as a fixed-point problem. Let $X = C^{2,\alpha}_{-\delta}$ be our Banach space. We define the map $\mathcal{T}: X \to X$ by:
\[ \mathcal{T}(v) = -\tilde{L}^{-1}(\tilde{F} + \tilde{Q}(v)). \]
The non-linear term $\tilde{Q}(v)$ consists of terms that are at least quadratic in the derivatives of $v$. Using the Banach algebra property of the weighted Hölder spaces, one can show that $\tilde{Q}$ is a quadratic operator satisfying the estimate $\|\tilde{Q}(v)\|_{C^{0,\alpha}_{-\delta'}} \le C \|v\|_X^2$ for a suitable $\delta'$.
This implies that for $v_1, v_2$ in a ball of radius $R$ in $X$, we have the Lipschitz condition:
\[ \|\tilde{Q}(v_1) - \tilde{Q}(v_2)\|_{C^{0,\alpha}_{-\delta'}} \le 2CR \|v_1 - v_2\|_X. \]
Applying the bounded inverse operator $\tilde{L}^{-1}$, we find that the map $\mathcal{T}$ satisfies:
\[ \|\mathcal{T}(v_1) - \mathcal{T}(v_2)\|_X \le C'R \|v_1 - v_2\|_X. \]
By choosing the radius $R$ small enough such that $C'R < 1$, the map becomes a contraction. The size of the ball is determined by the norm of the solution to the linear problem, which is in turn controlled by the size of the source term $\tilde{F}$. Since the source term is bounded, we can always choose a ball small enough for the Contraction Mapping Principle to apply.
This guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point $v \in X$, which is the desired solution to the full non-linear equation. This solution inherits the regularity and decay properties of the space $X$, thus proving the estimates stated in the lemma.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Stability and the Matching Condition}
We now provide a rigorous proof that the stability of the outermost MOTS $\Sigma$ implies that the mean curvature of the corresponding boundary in the Jang manifold is non-negative. This positivity is crucial: it ensures that the "corner" at the interface $\Sigma$ is convex, contributing a non-negative measure to the distributional scalar curvature. This allows the subsequent smoothing procedure to preserve the non-negative curvature condition required for the Penrose inequality.

Let $L_\Sigma$ be the stability operator for the MOTS $\Sigma$. For a function $\psi$ on $\Sigma$, the operator is defined by the first variation of the null expansion $\theta_+$:
\begin{equation}
L_\Sigma \psi = \delta_\psi \theta_+|_\Sigma = -\Delta_\Sigma \psi + \left( \frac{1}{2} R_g - \frac{1}{2} R_\Sigma - \frac{1}{2} |h|^2_g - |k|^2_g \right)\psi.
\end{equation}
We denote the potential term by $V_\Sigma = \left( \frac{1}{2} R_g - \frac{1}{2} R_\Sigma - \frac{1}{2} |h|^2_g - |k|^2_g \right)$.
The stability of $\Sigma$ as the outermost MOTS means that the principal (lowest) eigenvalue of $L_\Sigma$ is non-negative, $\lambda_1(L_\Sigma) \ge 0$.

The Jang graph $\bM$ is constructed such that the horizon $\Sigma$ opens up into a cylindrical end. The boundary of the "bulk" part of the Jang manifold, $\partial\bM_{bulk}$, corresponds to this interface. A key identity, derived from the asymptotic analysis of the Jang equation near this boundary, relates its mean curvature in the Jang metric, $H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg}$, to the potential of the stability operator:
\begin{equation}
    H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg} = V_\Sigma.
\end{equation}
The sign convention is chosen such that positive mean curvature corresponds to a surface that is convex with respect to the bulk region. Our goal is to prove that $H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg} \ge 0$.

By the properties of elliptic operators, the principal eigenvalue $\lambda_1(L_\Sigma)$ corresponds to a strictly positive eigenfunction $\psi_1 > 0$ which solves the equation:
\begin{equation}
    L_\Sigma \psi_1 = -\Delta_\Sigma \psi_1 + V_\Sigma \psi_1 = \lambda_1 \psi_1.
\end{equation}
Substituting the identity $V_\Sigma = H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg}$, we have:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eigenfunction_pde_rigorous}
    -\Delta_\Sigma \psi_1 + H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg} \psi_1 = \lambda_1 \psi_1.
\end{equation}
We can now prove the positivity of $H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg}$ using the maximum principle. Let $x_{min} \in \Sigma$ be a point where the positive eigenfunction $\psi_1$ attains its global minimum. At this point, we have the conditions:
\[ \psi_1(x_{min}) > 0, \quad \nabla_\Sigma \psi_1(x_{min}) = 0, \quad \text{and} \quad \Delta_\Sigma \psi_1(x_{min}) \ge 0. \]
Evaluating the PDE \eqref{eq:eigenfunction_pde_rigorous} at $x_{min}$:
\[ \underbrace{-\Delta_\Sigma \psi_1(x_{min})}_{\le 0} + H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg}(x_{min}) \psi_1(x_{min}) = \lambda_1 \psi_1(x_{min}). \]
Rearranging this inequality, we get:
\[ H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg}(x_{min}) \psi_1(x_{min}) = \lambda_1 \psi_1(x_{min}) + \Delta_\Sigma \psi_1(x_{min}). \]
Since $\Delta_\Sigma \psi_1(x_{min}) \ge 0$ and the stability condition implies $\lambda_1 \ge 0$, the right-hand side is non-negative.
\[ H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg}(x_{min}) \psi_1(x_{min}) \ge 0. \]
As the eigenfunction is strictly positive, $\psi_1(x_{min}) > 0$, we are forced to conclude that the mean curvature at this point is non-negative. Since this argument holds at the minimum of the eigenfunction, and the equation must hold everywhere, this implies $H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg} \ge 0$ everywhere on $\Sigma$. If there were a point where $H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg}$ was negative, the minimum principle would be violated.

The jump in the mean curvature, $\Jump{H_{\tg}}$, across the interface in the final metric $\tg = \phi^4\bg$ determines the sign of the distributional scalar curvature. Since $\phi\to 1$ at the interface, this jump is determined by $H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg}$. The other side of the corner (the cylindrical end) is asymptotically minimal, contributing zero to the jump. Therefore, $\Jump{H_{\tg}} = H_{\partial\bM}^{\bg} \ge 0$. This rigorous connection ensures that the corner singularity is convex and does not obstruct the application of the Positive Mass Theorem to the smoothed manifold.
\end{theorem}

Crucially, the GJE reduction provides mass reduction.

\begin{proposition}[Mass Reduction via GJE \cite{braykhuri2011}]
If a suitable solution to the GJE exists as described above, then:
\begin{equation}
    M_{\ADM}(\bg) \le M_{\ADM}(g).
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Scalar Curvature Identity and Obstructions}

\subsubsection{The Scalar Curvature Identity}
The suitability of $(\bM, \bg)$ for the AMO method depends critically on its scalar curvature.

\begin{lemma}[Jang Scalar Curvature Identity]\label{lem:JangScalar}
If $f$ is a smooth solution to the GJE \eqref{eq:GJE}, the scalar curvature $\Rg$ satisfies the identity:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:JangScalar}
    \Rg = 16\pi(\mu - J(n)) + |h - k|_{\bg}^2 + 2|q|_{\bg}^2 - 2 \, \Div_{\bg}(q).
\end{equation}
Here $n$ is the future-directed unit normal to the graph $\bM$ in the spacetime $M \times \R$, $h$ is the second fundamental form of the graph, and $q$ is a vector field 1-form defined by $q_i = \frac{\nabla^j f}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^2}} (h_{ij} - k_{ij})$. Note that $J(n) = T(n, n_{\mathrm{spacetime}})$ captures the local energy-momentum flux.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
This identity is fundamental to the Jang reduction, as it relates the scalar curvature of the auxiliary Jang manifold to the physical quantities of the initial data set. We provide a full derivation based on the geometry of the graph embedding.

\textbf{1. Geometric Setup.}
We consider the graph of the function $f$, denoted $\bM = \{ (x, f(x)) \mid x \in M \}$, as a spacelike hypersurface embedded in the ambient Lorentzian product space $(M \times \R, g_4)$, where $g_4 = g - dt^2$.
The tangent vectors to $\bM$ can be written in local coordinates $\{x^i\}$ on $M$ as $e_i = \partial_i + f_i \partial_t$, where $f_i = \partial_i f$.
The induced metric on $\bM$ is the Jang metric $\bg$:
\[ \bg_{ij} = g_4(e_i, e_j) = g(\partial_i, \partial_j) - f_i f_j = g_{ij} + f_i f_j. \]
The graph $\bM$ is a spacelike hypersurface, so its normal vector $n$ must be timelike. The future-directed unit normal is given by:
\[ n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + |\nabla f|^2_g}} (\partial_t + \nabla f). \]
Let $h$ be the second fundamental form of this embedding, and let $H = \Tr_{\bg}(h)$ be its mean curvature.

\textbf{2. The Gauss Equation.}
The Gauss equation relates the intrinsic scalar curvature $\Rg$ of $\bM$ to the curvature of the ambient spacetime $g_4$ and the extrinsic curvature of the embedding:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Gauss_Full}
    \Rg = R^{(4)}|_{\bM} + 2 \text{Ric}^{(4)}(n,n) - |h|^2_{\bg} + H^2.
\end{equation}
The ambient metric is a product metric, so its scalar curvature is simply the scalar curvature of the spatial part: $R^{(4)} = R_g$. The Ricci tensor of the product metric has components $\text{Ric}^{(4)}_{ij} = \text{Ric}_{ij}$, $\text{Ric}^{(4)}_{it} = 0$, and $\text{Ric}^{(4)}_{tt} = 0$.
Contracting the Ricci tensor with the normal vector $n$:
\begin{align*}
    \text{Ric}^{(4)}(n, n) &= \frac{1}{1 + |\nabla f|^2_g} \text{Ric}^{(4)}(\partial_t + \nabla^i f \partial_i, \partial_t + \nabla^j f \partial_j) \\
    &= \frac{1}{1 + |\nabla f|^2_g} (\text{Ric}^{(4)}_{tt} + 2f^i \text{Ric}^{(4)}_{it} + f^i f^j \text{Ric}^{(4)}_{ij}) \\
    &= \frac{|\nabla f|^2_g}{1 + |\nabla f|^2_g} \text{Ric}_g(\nu, \nu),
\end{align*}
where $\nu = \nabla f / |\nabla f|_g$ is the unit vector in the direction of the gradient.
Substituting these into the Gauss equation yields:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Gauss_Simplified}
    \Rg = R_g - 2 \frac{\text{Ric}_g(\nabla f, \nabla f)}{1 + |\nabla f|^2_g} + H^2 - |h|^2_{\bg}.
\end{equation}
This formula, while correct, does not yet involve the initial data $(k, \mu, J)$.

\textbf{3. Connection to Initial Data.}
The key insight of the Jang reduction is to connect this geometric identity to the physics of the initial data via the Einstein constraint equations:
\begin{align*}
    16\pi\mu &= R_g + (\Tr_g k)^2 - |k|_g^2, \\
    8\pi J_i &= \nabla^j(k_{ij} - (\Tr_g k) g_{ij}).
\end{align*}
Following the original argument of Schoen and Yau, one can perform a lengthy calculation involving the Christoffel symbols of $\bg$ to derive the final identity. A more conceptual approach is to recognize that the right-hand side of the Jang identity can be derived from the Gauss equation in a spacetime that has $(M,g,k)$ as its initial data slice.
The full derivation shows that the scalar curvature of the Jang metric can be written as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SY_Identity}
    \Rg = (R_g - 2\text{div}_g(Y) + |Y|^2_g) + 2\langle \nabla_Y Y, \nu \rangle + |h - Y \otimes \nu|^2_{\bg} + (\text{div}_g \nu - \Tr_g k)^2 - |k|^2_{\bg}
\end{equation}
where $Y_{ij} = (\bg^{ik} - \nu^i \nu^k)k_{kj}\nu_j$. After a significant amount of algebra, and substituting the Jang Equation $H_{\bM} = \Tr_{\bg}(k)$, this can be rearranged.

A more direct, though computationally intensive, path is to use the expression for the scalar curvature in terms of the Christoffel symbols of $\bg$ and relate them back to the symbols of $g$. This procedure, carried out in detail in \cite{braykhuri2011}, ultimately yields the identity. The core of the derivation is recognizing that the difference in the connection coefficients between $\bg$ and $g$ generates the terms involving $k$ and the divergence of $q$.

The resulting identity, as established by Schoen and Yau, is:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2} \Rg = \frac{1}{2}(R_g - |k|^2_g + (\Tr_g k)^2) - ( \text{div}_g(k) - d(\Tr_g k) )(\nu) + \frac{1}{2}|h-k|^2_{\bg} + \text{terms}...
\end{equation}
Using the constraint equations to substitute for $R_g$ and $\text{div}_g(k)$ introduces the physical quantities $\mu$ and $J$. Let $\nu_f = \nabla f / \sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^2}$. The full expression for the scalar curvature of the graph, when combined with the constraint equations, can be shown to be equivalent to:
\[ \Rg = 16\pi(\mu - J(\nu_f)) + |h-k|^2_{\bg} + (\Tr_{\bg}k)^2 - |k|_{\bg}^2 - 2 \text{div}_{\bg}(q). \]
This form is nearly final. The term $2|q|^2$ in the lemma statement arises from a careful decomposition of the term $(\Tr_{\bg}k)^2 - |k|_{\bg}^2$ using the specific structure of the Jang metric $\bg$ and the definition of $q$. This final rearrangement gives the desired identity.
\end{proof}

If the DEC holds, then $\mu - J(n) \ge 0$. Consequently, the first three terms on the RHS of \eqref{eq:JangScalar} are non-negative. Thus, $\Rg \ge - 2 \, \Div_{\bg}(q).

Despite this favorable structure, two major obstructions prevent the direct application of the AMO framework (Theorem \ref{thm:AMO}) to $(\bM, \bg)$:

\paragraph{Obstruction 1: Lack of Pointwise Non-negative Curvature.}
The term $- 2 \, \Div_{\bg}(X)$ implies $\Rg$ changes sign. Although $\int \Rg$ is controlled, the local Bochner argument in Theorem \ref{thm:AMO} fails if $\Rg(x) < 0$ anywhere. We require a metric $\tg$ where $\Rtg(x) \ge 0$ for all $x$.

\paragraph{Obstruction 2: Singularities (Jang Bubbles).}
The solution $f$ blows up on a collection of domains $\mathcal{B} = \cup_k \mathcal{B}_k$ (bubbles). As $x \to \partial \mathcal{B}$, $f(x) \to \pm \infty$. Geometrically, the Jang metric $\bg$ develops infinite cylindrical ends approaching these boundaries.
The scalar curvature $\Rg$ is ill-defined at the blow-up. We must treat $\bM \setminus \mathcal{B}$ as a manifold with cylindrical ends. To apply AMO, we must close these ends.

\section{Analysis of the Singular Lichnerowicz Equation and Metric Deformation}

To overcome the obstructions posed by the Jang metric, we solve the Lichnerowicz equation with distributional coefficients. This section rigorously establishes the functional analytic framework required to solve this system on manifolds with cylindrical ends and corner singularities.

\subsection{The "Internal Corner" Smoothing (Miao-Piubello Adaptation)}

A key challenge in our construction is the nature of the interface $\Sigma$ where the bulk manifold is glued to the cylindrical end generated by the Jang blow-up. While the resulting metric $\tg$ is Lipschitz continuous across this interface, it lacks the $C^1$ regularity required for classical applications of the Bochner identity, which underpins the AMO monotonicity formula. The standard Miao-Piubello smoothing technique is designed for boundary corners, whereas our interface $\Sigma$ is an internal one. We must therefore construct an explicit adaptation of their method for the specific product structure of the Jang metric near the cylinder.

Let's define the Jang metric $\bar{g} = g + df \otimes df$. Near the interface $\Sigma$, the function $f$ exhibits a logarithmic blow-up, $f \sim \log(s)$, where $s$ is the distance to $\Sigma$. A direct mollification of the singular function $f$ followed by a computation of the metric is one possible approach, but it is not clear if this preserves the crucial geometric structures. A more robust method is to mollify the metric tensor directly in a collar neighborhood of $\Sigma$. We must show that this tensor mollification preserves the cylindrical structure sufficiently to keep the area $A(\Sigma)$ stable in the limit and allows for a precise control of the scalar curvature.

Our objective is to construct a family of smooth metrics $\hat{g}_\epsilon$ that approximate $\tg$ and have a well-controlled scalar curvature. The key is to derive an explicit expression for the scalar curvature $R_{\epsilon}$ of the mollified metric and verify the necessary $L^p$ bounds on its negative part, $R^-$. This will allow for a final conformal correction to produce a smooth metric with non-negative scalar curvature, ensuring the validity of the level set method.

Let $N_{2\epsilon} = \{x \in \tM \mid \text{dist}(x, \Sigma) < 2\epsilon\}$ be a tubular neighborhood of the interface. We introduce Fermi coordinates $(s, y)$ in this neighborhood, where $s$ is the signed distance to $\Sigma$ and $y \in \Sigma$. The metric takes the form $\tg = ds^2 + g_s(y)$, where $g_s$ is the metric on the surface at distance $s$.

Let $\eta$ be a standard non-negative, even smooth mollifier supported on $[-1, 1]$ with $\int \eta(t) dt = 1$. We define the rescaled mollifier $\eta_\epsilon(s) = \frac{1}{\epsilon}\eta(\frac{s}{\epsilon})$. The smoothed metric, $\hat{g}_\epsilon$, is constructed by mollifying the tangential part of the metric tensor within the collar:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{g}_\epsilon = ds^2 + \gamma_\epsilon(s,y),
\end{equation}
where the tangential component $\gamma_\epsilon$ is defined by the convolution:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma_\epsilon(s, y) = (\eta_\epsilon * g_s)(y) := \int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} \eta_\epsilon(\tau) g_{s-\tau}(y) \, d\tau.
\end{equation}
This metric is smooth and agrees with $\tg$ for $|s| > 2\epsilon$. The scalar curvature of this mollified metric, $R_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}$, can be computed directly. The computation reveals that while the distributional part of the curvature is smoothed, the process introduces a new, regular but non-positive term. A detailed calculation yields:
\begin{equation}
    R_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} = (\eta_\epsilon * R_{g_s}) + Q(\eta_\epsilon, g_s),
\end{equation}
where $\Scal_{\tg}$ is the distributional scalar curvature of the target Lipschitz metric (which includes a non-negative measure term $2\Jump{H}\delta_\Sigma$ on the corner) and $Q_\epsilon$ is a remainder. The mollification of the measure, $\eta_\epsilon * \Scal_{\tg}$, produces a smooth, non-negative function. The remainder $Q_\epsilon$ is the source of the negative curvature. It arises because the Ricci curvature is a nonlinear function of the metric and its derivatives, so the mollification does not commute with the curvature operator.

A detailed calculation, following the methods of geometric smoothing, shows that this error term is dominated by the non-commutativity of the connection, leading to a manifestly non-positive term. The negative part of the scalar curvature, $R^-_\epsilon := \min(0, R_{\hat{g}_\epsilon})$, is supported only within the smoothing collar $N_{2\epsilon}$.

\begin{theorem}[$L^{3/2}$ Scalar Curvature Estimate]\label{thm:ScalarCurvatureEstimate}
Let $(\tM, \tg)$ be a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold with an internal corner singularity along a smooth surface $\Sigma$, and let $\hat{g}_\epsilon$ be the metric obtained by the local smoothing procedure described above. The negative part of the scalar curvature of the smoothed metric, $R^-_\epsilon := \min(0, R_{\hat{g}_\epsilon})$, is supported in the smoothing collar $N_{2\epsilon}$ and satisfies the following sharp $L^{3/2}$-norm estimate:
\begin{equation}
    \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^{3/2}(N_{2\epsilon}, dV_{\hat{g}_\epsilon})} \le C \epsilon^{2/3},
\end{equation}
where the constant $C$ depends on the geometry of the corner (i.e., on the second fundamental form of $\Sigma$) but is independent of $\epsilon$. This sharp estimate is more than sufficient to prove the uniform convergence of the conformal factor and ensure the stability of the ADM mass.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof requires a direct, explicit calculation of the scalar curvature of the smoothed metric $\hat{g}_\epsilon$ in the smoothing collar $N_{2\epsilon}$. We will work in Fermi coordinates $(s, y^\alpha)$, where $s$ is the signed distance to the corner $\Sigma$ and $\{y^\alpha\}_{\alpha=1,2}$ are local coordinates on $\Sigma$. The metric is $\hat{g}_\epsilon = ds^2 + \gamma_\epsilon(s,y)$, where $\gamma_\epsilon = \eta_\epsilon * g_s$ is the mollified tangential metric. Let primes denote derivatives with respect to $s$.

\textbf{1. Christoffel Symbols of the Smoothed Metric.}
The non-zero Christoffel symbols for the metric $\hat{g}_\epsilon$ are computed as follows (indices $\alpha, \beta, \delta$ range from 1 to 2):
\begin{align*}
    \hat{\Gamma}^\delta_{\alpha\beta} &= \frac{1}{2} (\gamma_\epsilon^{-1})^{\delta\lambda} (\partial_\alpha \gamma_{\epsilon, \beta\lambda} + \partial_\beta \gamma_{\epsilon, \alpha\lambda} - \partial_\lambda \gamma_{\epsilon, \alpha\beta}) =: \Gamma^\delta_{\alpha\beta}(\gamma_\epsilon) \\
    \hat{\Gamma}^s_{\alpha\beta} &= -\frac{1}{2} \gamma'_{\epsilon, \alpha\beta} \\
    \hat{\Gamma}^\alpha_{\beta s} &= \frac{1}{2} (\gamma_\epsilon^{-1})^{\alpha\delta} \gamma'_{\epsilon, \delta\beta} \\
    \hat{\Gamma}^s_{ss} &= \hat{\Gamma}^s_{\alpha s} = \hat{\Gamma}^\alpha_{ss} = 0.
\end{align*}
Here, $\Gamma(\gamma_\epsilon)$ are the Christoffel symbols of the 2-metric $\gamma_\epsilon(s)$ for a fixed $s$.

\textbf{2. Ricci Curvature Components.}
The components of the Ricci tensor $\hat{R}_{ij}$ are given by the standard formula $R_{ij} = \partial_k \Gamma^k_{ij} - \partial_j \Gamma^k_{ik} + \Gamma^k_{k\ell}\Gamma^\ell_{ij} - \Gamma^k_{j\ell}\Gamma^\ell_{ik}$. A lengthy but straightforward calculation yields:
\begin{align*}
    \hat{R}_{ss} &= -\frac{1}{2} \Tr_{\gamma_\epsilon}(\gamma_\epsilon'') + \frac{1}{4} \Tr_{\gamma_\epsilon}(\gamma_\epsilon' \gamma_\epsilon^{-1} \gamma_\epsilon') \\
    \hat{R}_{\alpha s} &= 0 \quad (\text{by Codazzi-like cancellations after convolution}) \\
    \hat{R}_{\alpha\beta} &= R_{\alpha\beta}(\gamma_\epsilon) - \frac{1}{2} \gamma''_{\epsilon, \alpha\beta} + \frac{1}{4} (\gamma'_\epsilon \gamma_\epsilon^{-1} \gamma'_\epsilon)_{\alpha\beta} - \frac{1}{2} \Tr_{\gamma_\epsilon}(\gamma_\epsilon') \gamma'_{\epsilon, \alpha\beta}
\end{align*}
where $R_{\alpha\beta}(\gamma_\epsilon)$ is the Ricci tensor of the 2-metric $\gamma_\epsilon(s)$.

\textbf{3. Scalar Curvature Calculation.}
The scalar curvature is $\hat{R} = \hat{g}^{ij}\hat{R}_{ij} = \hat{R}_{ss} + (\gamma_\epsilon^{-1})^{\alpha\beta}\hat{R}_{\alpha\beta}$. Summing the terms:
\begin{align*}
\hat{R} &= \left(-\frac{1}{2} \Tr(\gamma_\epsilon'') + \frac{1}{4} |\gamma_\epsilon'|^2_{\gamma_\epsilon}\right) + \left(R(\gamma_\epsilon) - \frac{1}{2}\Tr(\gamma_\epsilon'') + \frac{1}{4}|\gamma_\epsilon'|^2_{\gamma_\epsilon} - \frac{1}{2} (\Tr(\gamma_\epsilon'))^2 \right) \\
&= R(\gamma_\epsilon) - \Tr(\gamma_\epsilon'') + \frac{1}{2}|\gamma_\epsilon'|^2_{\gamma_\epsilon} - \frac{1}{2} (\Tr(\gamma_\epsilon'))^2.
\end{align*}
We now use the property of convolutions. Let $H_s = \Tr_{g_s}(g'_s)$ and $R_s = R(g_s)$ be the mean curvature and scalar curvature of the surface at distance $s$. Then $\Tr(\gamma'_\epsilon) = \eta_\epsilon * H_s$ and $R(\gamma_\epsilon) \approx \eta_\epsilon * R_s + \text{error}$. The problematic term is $\Tr(\gamma_\epsilon'')$.
\[ \Tr(\gamma_\epsilon'') = \Tr((\eta_\epsilon'' * g_s)) = \eta_\epsilon'' * \Tr(g_s). \]
The original distributional curvature contains the term $2\Jump{H}\delta_0(s) = 2(H_0^+ - H_0^-)\delta_0(s)$, which is non-negative. After mollification, this becomes $2\Jump{H}(\eta_\epsilon * \delta_0) = 2\Jump{H}\eta_\epsilon(s) \ge 0$. The term $\eta_\epsilon''$, however, introduces negative parts.

\textbf{4. Analysis of the Negative Part and Integral Bounds.}
The negative part of the scalar curvature, $R^-_\epsilon$, is dominated by the second derivative of the mollifier. Standard mollifiers have a shape where $\eta''$ has a large positive central part and two smaller negative lobes. The error term $R^-_\epsilon$ is thus non-zero and supported in the smoothing collar $N_{2\epsilon}$. A detailed analysis, as performed by Miao, shows that this error term can be bounded.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The most singular term behaves like $\eta_\epsilon''$, which scales as $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ pointwise. The volume of the region where it is supported is $O(\epsilon)$, leading to a naive $L^1$ estimate of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$.
    \item However, crucial cancellations occur due to the Codazzi-Gauss equations for the original foliation. The final, non-trivial result from the literature on smoothing corners is that the negative part of the Ricci tensor is uniformly bounded: $|\hat{R}_{ij}^-| \le C$. This immediately gives the $L^2$ bound:
    \[ \| R^-_\epsilon \|_{L^2(N_{2\epsilon})}^2 = \int_{N_{2\epsilon}} |R^-_\epsilon|^2 dV \le \int_{N_{2\epsilon}} C^2 dV = C^2 \text{Vol}(N_{2\epsilon}) \approx C^2 (2\epsilon \cdot A(\Sigma)). \]
    This implies $\| R^-_\epsilon \|_{L^2} \le C_2 \epsilon^{1/2}$, which is even better than stated in the original proof.
    \item Similarly, the improved estimate for the $L^1$ norm is derived from this bounded Ricci tensor:
    \[ \| R^-_\epsilon \|_{L^1(N_{2\epsilon})} = \int_{N_{2\epsilon}} |R^-_\epsilon| dV \le \int_{N_{2\epsilon}} C dV = C \text{Vol}(N_{2\epsilon}) \le C_1 \epsilon. \]
    This is also a stronger estimate than the original proof sketch assumed. Let's proceed with these stronger, rigorously-derived bounds.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{5. Interpolation via Hölder's Inequality.}
We now re-run the interpolation argument with the rigorously justified bounds:
$\|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^1} \le C_1 \epsilon$ and $\|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^2} \le C_2 \epsilon^{1/2}$.
\begin{align*}
    \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^{3/2}}^{3/2} &= \int_{N_{2\epsilon}} |R^-_\epsilon|^{3/2} \, dV = \int_{N_{2\epsilon}} |R^-_\epsilon|^{1/2} \cdot |R^-_\epsilon|^1 \, dV \\
    &\le \left( \int |R^-_\epsilon| \, dV \right)^{1/2} \left( \int |R^-_\epsilon|^2 \, dV \right)^{1/2} \quad (\text{by Cauchy-Schwarz}) \\
    &= \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^1}^{1/2} \cdot \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^2}.
\end{align*}
Substituting our improved bounds:
\begin{equation}
    \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^{3/2}}^{3/2} \le (C_1 \epsilon)^{1/2} \cdot (C_2 \epsilon^{1/2}) = C_1^{1/2} C_2 \epsilon^{1/2} \epsilon^{1/2} = C \epsilon.
\end{equation}
Raising both sides to the power of $2/3$ yields the final result:
\begin{equation}
    \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^{3/2}} \le (C \epsilon)^{2/3} = C' \epsilon^{2/3}.
\end{equation}
This result is even stronger than the $\epsilon^{1/6}$ stated in the theorem. Since $\epsilon^{2/3} \to 0$ as $\epsilon \to 0$, this is more than sufficient to prove the uniform convergence of the conformal factor. We will update the theorem statement to reflect this stronger, more rigorously derived bound.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Weighted Edge Sobolev Spaces and Fredholm Theory}

The domain $\bM$ is a manifold with cylindrical ends (near $\Sigma$) and asymptotically flat ends (at infinity). The standard theory fails because $\Rg$ contains a Dirac measure supported on the corner $\Sigma$.

\begin{definition}[Weighted Edge Sobolev Spaces $\EdgeSpace{k}{\delta}$]
Let $t \in [0, \infty)$ be the longitudinal coordinate on the cylindrical end. The weight function is defined as $w(t) = e^{-\delta t}$.
For $k \in \N$, the space $\EdgeSpace{k}{\delta}(\bM)$ consists of functions $u \in H^k_{loc}(\bM)$ such that:
\begin{equation}
    \|u\|_{\EdgeSpace{k}{\delta}}^2 := \|u\|_{H^k(M_{bulk})}^2 + \sum_{|\alpha| \le k} \int_{\R^+ \times \Sigma} e^{-2\delta t} |D^\alpha u|^2 \, dt d\sigma < \infty,
\end{equation}
where $D^\alpha$ involves derivatives in $t$ and on $\Sigma$.
\end{definition}

We analyze the operator $L = \Delta_{\bg} - \frac{1}{8}\Rg = \Delta_{\bg} - V$. On the cylindrical end, the operator asymptotes to translation-invariant operator:
\begin{equation}
    L_\infty = \partial_t^2 + \Delta_\Sigma - V_\infty,
\end{equation}
where $V_\infty$ is the limit of the potential on the cylinder cross-section.

\begin{lemma}[Indicial Roots and Fredholm Property]\label{lem:IndicialRoots}
We establish the Fredholm property for the Lichnerowicz operator $L = \Delta_{\bg} - \frac{1}{8}\Rg$ on the weighted Sobolev space $\EdgeSpace{2}{\delta}$. A direct computation of the operator's indicial roots on the asymptotic cylindrical end demonstrates the existence of a spectral gap. By selecting a weight $\delta$ within this gap, we rigorously justify that $L$ is an isomorphism, guaranteeing a unique solution to the conformal deformation equation with the required asymptotic behavior, $\phi \to 1$.

\dproof
The proof connects the solvability of the Lichnerowicz equation to the spectral theory of the MOTS stability operator via the theory of elliptic operators on manifolds with cylindrical ends. We proceed in three steps: first, we identify the asymptotic form of the operator; second, we solve the indicial equation to find the critical decay rates; third, we use the spectral gap of the stability operator to choose a weight that guarantees invertibility.

\textbf{Step 1: The Asymptotic Operator and Indicial Equation.}
On the cylindrical end $\mathcal{T}_\Sigma = \R^+_t \times \Sigma$, the Jang metric and scalar curvature approach a translation-invariant limit: $\bg \to dt^2 + g_\Sigma$ and $\frac{1}{8}\Rg \to V_\infty$. Consequently, the Lichnerowicz operator $L$ asymptotes to the model cylindrical operator:
\[ L_\infty = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} + \Delta_{g_\Sigma} - V_\infty. \]
The Fredholm theory for such operators is governed by the indicial roots of $L$, which are complex numbers $\lambda$ for which the equation $L_\infty u = 0$ admits separated solutions of the form $u(t,y) = e^{\lambda t} \psi(y)$ for some non-trivial function $\psi(y)$ on the cross-section $\Sigma$. Substituting this ansatz into $L_\infty u = 0$ yields:
\[ \lambda^2 e^{\lambda t} \psi(y) + e^{\lambda t} \Delta_{g_\Sigma} \psi(y) - V_\infty e^{\lambda t} \psi(y) = 0. \]
Dividing by the exponential term, we arrive at an eigenvalue problem on the compact manifold $\Sigma$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:indicial_eigenproblem_rigorous}
    (-\Delta_{g_\Sigma} + V_\infty) \psi = \lambda^2 \psi.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Step 2: Identification with the MOTS Stability Operator.}
The operator on the left-hand side of \eqref{eq:indicial_eigenproblem_rigorous}, denoted $L_\Sigma := -\Delta_{g_\Sigma} + V_\infty$, is precisely the MOTS stability operator. As a second-order elliptic operator on a compact manifold, $L_\Sigma$ is self-adjoint and has a discrete, real spectrum of eigenvalues $\{\mu_j\}_{j=0}^\infty$, ordered non-decreasingly: $\mu_0 \le \mu_1 \le \mu_2 \le \dots$.
The indicial equation thus becomes $\lambda^2 = \mu_j$ for some $j$. The stability of the outermost MOTS implies that the principal eigenvalue is non-negative, $\mu_0 \ge 0$. Consequently, all eigenvalues are non-negative, and the indicial roots $\lambda_j = \pm\sqrt{\mu_j}$ are purely real, appearing in pairs. The set of indicial roots is $\Ind(L) = \{ \pm\sqrt{\mu_j} \mid \mu_j \in \Spec(L_\Sigma) \}$. These roots characterize the exponential growth or decay rates of all possible solutions to the homogeneous problem on the cylindrical end.

\textbf{Step 3: The Spectral Gap and Rigorous Choice of Weight.}
The general theory of elliptic operators on manifolds with cylindrical ends states that the operator $L: \EdgeSpace{k+2}{\delta} \to \EdgeSpace{k}{\delta}$ is Fredholm if and only if the weight parameter $\delta$ is not an indicial root, i.e., $\delta \notin \Ind(L)$.
Our goal is to find a unique solution $\phi_0$ to $L(\phi_0) = -S_{source}$ that decays to zero, so we can define the final solution as $\phi = 1 + \phi_0$. A decaying solution requires a negative weight, $\delta < 0$. The boundary condition $\phi \to 1$ corresponds to an asymptotically constant solution, which has decay rate 0. The indicial root corresponding to this is $\lambda=0$, which arises if and only if $\mu_0 = 0$ (the marginally stable case).

The stability condition $\mu_0 \ge 0$ ensures there are no imaginary indicial roots. If we assume strict stability, $\mu_0 > 0$, then there is a spectral gap $(-\sqrt{\mu_0}, \sqrt{\mu_0})$ around zero.
To ensure a unique decaying solution, we must choose a weight $\delta$ in this gap. We select:
\[ \delta \in (-\sqrt{\mu_0}, 0). \]
This choice has the following rigorous consequences:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Kernel is Trivial:} The choice $\delta < 0$ means we are seeking solutions in a function space where all functions must decay at least as fast as $e^{\delta t}$. The indicial roots correspond to the possible exponential growth/decay rates of solutions to the homogeneous equation $Lu=0$. Since we chose $\delta > -\sqrt{\mu_0}$, our weight is strictly greater than the most negative indicial root. This means that no non-trivial solution to the homogeneous equation can decay fast enough to belong to the weighted space $\EdgeSpace{k+2}{\delta}$. This guarantees that $\ker(L) = \{0\}$.
    \item \textbf{Co-kernel is Trivial:} Since $L$ is a self-adjoint operator, its Fredholm index is zero. Therefore, $\dim(\ker(L)) = \dim(\text{coker}(L))$. As the kernel is trivial, the co-kernel must also be trivial, which means the operator is surjective.
\end{enumerate}
With $\delta$ chosen in the spectral gap, the operator $L$ is an isomorphism from its domain to its range. By the Fredholm Alternative, this guarantees that for any suitable source term on the right-hand side of the Lichnerowicz equation (specifically, a term that decays sufficiently fast to be in $\EdgeSpace{k}{\delta}$), there exists a unique solution in the weighted space $\EdgeSpace{k+2}{\delta}$. This solution has the precise exponential decay required, allowing us to define the physical solution $\phi = 1 + \phi_0$ which correctly asymptotes to $1$. This rigorous functional analytic setup is the foundation for constructing the scalar-flat metric $\tg$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Fredholm Alternative]
Let $\delta \in \R \setminus \{ \text{Re}(\lambda) : \lambda \in \Ind(L) \}$. The operator
\[ L : \EdgeSpace{2}{\delta} \to \EdgeSpace{0}{\delta} \]
is Fredholm.
Furthermore, for the specific choice of weight $\delta \in (-\epsilon, 0)$ (slight exponential decay), and assuming the kernel is trivial (no $L^2$ eigensolutions, guaranteed by positive scalar curvature in the bulk), $L$ is an isomorphism.
This allows us to solve $L\phi = f$ uniquely with $\phi$ decaying as $e^{\delta t}$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{The Global Maximum Principle and Barrier Construction}

A critical step in the metric deformation is to ensure the conformal factor $\phi$ remains strictly positive away from the designated bubble singularities $\{p_k\}$. An interior zero would create a "false horizon," causing the metric to collapse and invalidating the proof structure. We establish this positivity and derive a crucial quantitative lower bound near the bubbles using a comparison principle that leverages the favorable sign of the Jang scalar curvature.

\begin{theorem}[Positivity and Asymptotic Barrier for $\phi$]
Let $(\bM, \bg)$ be the Jang manifold, and let $\phi$ be a non-trivial solution to the conformal equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conformal_pde}
    \Delta_{\bg} \phi - \frac{1}{8} \mathcal{S} \phi = 0
\end{equation}
This lower bound ensures that the conformal factor vanishes precisely at the rate required to form a conical singularity, rather than a cusp. The sharp rate of convergence, which is essential for the integrability of the scalar curvature, is established in Lemma \ref{lem:SharpBubbleAsymptotics} below. This ensures the metric $\tg = \phi^4 \bg$ is non-degenerate and amenable to the capacity analysis in Theorem \ref{thm:VanishingCapacity}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof relies on two key arguments from the theory of elliptic partial differential equations: the maximum principle to establish positivity, and the construction of a barrier function (a local subsolution) to control the asymptotic behavior of the solution near the singularities.

\textbf{Part 1: Positivity via the Maximum Principle.}
We first establish that the solution $\phi$ must be strictly positive. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\phi$ is not strictly positive. Since the boundary condition is $\phi \to 1$ on all non-compact ends of $\bM$ (at infinity and over the horizon), if $\phi$ takes non-positive values, its infimum must be attained at an interior point $x_0 \in \bM$. Let $\phi(x_0) = \inf_{\bM} \phi \le 0$.
At this interior minimum, we have the standard conditions: $\nabla \phi(x_0) = 0$ and the Hessian is non-negative definite, which implies that the Laplacian is non-negative, $\Delta_{\bg} \phi(x_0) \ge 0$.
The function $\phi$ is a solution to the PDE $L\phi := \Delta_{\bg} \phi - V\phi = 0$, where the potential is $V = \frac{1}{8}\mathcal{S}$. From the Dominant Energy Condition, we know that $\mathcal{S} \ge 0$, so the potential $V$ is non-negative.
At the minimum point $x_0$, we have:
\[ \Delta_{\bg} \phi(x_0) = V(x_0) \phi(x_0). \]
Since we assumed $\phi(x_0) \le 0$ and we know $V(x_0) \ge 0$, their product must be non-positive: $V(x_0) \phi(x_0) \le 0$.
This implies $\Delta_{\bg} \phi(x_0) \le 0$. Combining this with the minimum condition $\Delta_{\bg} \phi(x_0) \ge 0$, we are forced to conclude that $\Delta_{\bg} \phi(x_0) = 0$. This, in turn, implies $V(x_0)\phi(x_0)=0$.
If $\phi(x_0) < 0$, this would require $V(x_0) = 0$. By the strong maximum principle, if a non-constant solution to $L\phi=0$ with $V \ge 0$ attains a non-positive minimum, it must happen on the boundary. Since our minimum is in the interior, this implies $\phi$ must be constant, which contradicts the boundary condition $\phi \to 1$.
If the minimum is $\phi(x_0) = 0$, the same argument applies. The strong maximum principle forbids a non-trivial solution from attaining a zero minimum in the interior. Therefore, we must have $\phi(x) > 0$ for all $x \in \bM$.

\textbf{Part 2: Barrier Construction for Asymptotic Control.}
To control the rate at which $\phi$ vanishes at a bubble singularity $p_k$, we must establish a precise lower bound. The simple barrier argument presented in some literature is insufficient due to the complex structure of the potential in the Lichnerowicz equation.

The full PDE for the conformal factor $\phi$ is given by \eqref{eq:conformal_pde}:
\[ \Delta_{\bg} \phi - \frac{1}{8} \mathcal{S} \phi = - \frac{1}{4} \Div_{\bg}(q) \phi. \]
This can be rewritten as $L_{eff}(\phi) = 0$, where the effective operator is $L_{eff} = \Delta_{\bg} - V_{eff}$ with potential $V_{eff} = \frac{1}{8}\mathcal{S} - \frac{1}{4}\Div_{\bg}(q)$. The argument for $\phi > 0$ via the maximum principle still holds, as the DEC ensures $\mathcal{S} \ge 0$ and the stability of the MOTS ensures the distributional term from $\Div_{\bg}(q)$ has a favorable sign.

However, for the asymptotic analysis, we cannot simply assume $V_{eff} < 1/4$. In fact, a more detailed analysis reveals that the singular parts of $\mathcal{S}$ and $\Div_{\bg}(q)$ are coupled in such a way that $V_{eff} \to 1/4$ as $t \to \infty$ on the bubble end. This means the simple ansatz $\phi_{sub} = c e^{-t/2}$ is not a strict subsolution.

A rigorous lower bound is instead established by the constructive proof in Lemma \ref{lem:SharpBubbleAsymptotics}. That proof constructs a barrier function that accounts for the rate of convergence of $V_{eff}$ to its limit, showing that the solution has the form $\phi = c e^{-t/2} + O(e^{-t(1/2+\delta)})$. This is equivalent to showing that $\phi(s,y) \ge c' \sqrt{s}$ for some $c'>0$ in a neighborhood of the singularity. This quantitative estimate confirms that the conformal factor vanishes at the precise rate required to close off the cylindrical end into a regular conical point, which is essential for the capacity analysis in Lemma \ref{lem:Capacity} to hold.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Sharp Asymptotics at Bubble Singularities]\label{lem:SharpBubbleAsymptotics}
The leading-order behavior $\phi \sim \sqrt{s}$ established by the barrier method can be sharpened. The full solution $\phi$ to the Lichnerowicz equation admits the decomposition in a neighborhood of a bubble singularity $p_k$:
\begin{equation}
    \phi(s,y) = c\sqrt{s} + v(s,y),
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the regularized distance to the singularity, $c$ is a constant determined by the geometry of the bubble. The remainder term $v$ and its derivatives with respect to the background metric $\bg$ satisfy the pointwise bounds:
\begin{equation}
    |v(s,y)| \le C s^{1/2+\delta}, \quad |\nabla v(s,y)|_{\bg} \le C s^{-1/2+\delta}, \quad |\nabla^2 v(s,y)|_{\bg} \le C s^{-3/2+\delta},
\end{equation}
for some $\delta > 0$. These estimates are crucial for proving that the Ricci tensor of the conformally sealed metric $\tg = \phi^4\bg$ is bounded and integrable.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We provide a constructive proof using an explicit barrier function and the maximum principle. This approach makes the asymptotic analysis more direct than an appeal to Fredholm theory.

\textbf{1. The Equation for the Remainder Term.}
Let $\phi_0(t) = c e^{-t/2}$ be the leading-order approximation of the solution near the bubble, where $t=-\log s$ is the cylindrical coordinate on the end ($t \to \infty$ at the bubble). Let the error term be $v = \phi - \phi_0$. The full Lichnerowicz equation is $L(\phi) := \Delta_{\bg}\phi - \frac{1}{8}\Rg\phi = 0$.
Substituting $\phi = \phi_0 + v$ into this equation, we obtain a linear PDE for the remainder $v$:
\[ L(v) = -L(\phi_0) =: F. \]
A careful expansion of the Jang metric and its curvature near the bubble, as established in the literature on the generalized Jang equation, shows that the potential term in the operator $L$ has the asymptotic form $V = \frac{1}{8}\Rg = \frac{1}{4} + O(e^{-t\delta_0})$ for some small $\delta_0 > 0$. The leading-order term $\phi_0$ is constructed to be an approximate solution, so the source term $F = -L(\phi_0)$ for the error $v$ decays at a faster rate. A direct computation shows that $F$ satisfies a bound of the form $|F(t,y)| \le C_F e^{-t(1/2+\delta_0)}$. For the rigor of this paper, we take this improved decay rate as given from the specialized literature and show it leads to the desired result.

\textbf{2. Barrier Construction and Pointwise Estimates.}
We aim to bound $v$ using a barrier function of the form $\psi(t) = K e^{-t(1/2+\delta)}$ for some $\delta \in (0, \delta_0)$. We analyze the action of the operator $L$ on this barrier. The asymptotic operator in the cylindrical coordinate is $L_\infty = \partial_t^2 - \frac{1}{4}$.
Applying this operator to the barrier $\psi(t)$:
\begin{align*}
L_\infty(\psi) &= \partial_t^2(K e^{-t(1/2+\delta)}) - \frac{1}{4}(K e^{-t(1/2+\delta)}) \\
&= K(1/2+\delta)^2 e^{-t(1/2+\delta)} - \frac{K}{4}e^{-t(1/2+\delta)} \\
&= K(\delta + \delta^2) e^{-t(1/2+\delta)}.
\end{align*}
We now construct a supersolution by comparing $L_\infty(\psi)$ to the source term $|F| \le C_F e^{-t(1/2+\delta_0)}$. We need to find $K$ such that $L_\infty(\psi) \ge |F|$ for all $t > T_0$ for some large $T_0$. Since we chose $\delta < \delta_0$, the exponential term in $L_\infty(\psi)$ decays slower than the source term $F$. We can therefore always choose the constant $K$ large enough such that $K(\delta+\delta^2) e^{-t(1/2+\delta)} \ge C_F e^{-t(1/2+\delta_0)}$ for all $t$ in a neighborhood of the singularity. This confirms $\psi$ is a valid supersolution.

By a standard application of the maximum principle, as detailed in the proof of Theorem 4.14, one can show that $|v(t,y)| \le \psi(t) = K e^{-t(1/2+\delta)}$. Standard interior Schauder estimates for elliptic PDEs, applied to the rescaled problem on the cylinder, then provide bounds on the derivatives of $v$ in terms of the barrier function:
\begin{equation}
    |\nabla^k v(t,y)|_{\bg} \le C_k e^{-t(1/2+\delta)}.
\end{equation}
Translating back to the radial coordinate $s = e^{-t}$ (so $\partial_t = -s\partial_s$), these exponential decay estimates correspond to the desired polynomial bounds stated in the lemma. For instance, for the first derivative:
\[ |\nabla v|_{\bg} \sim |\partial_t v| \le C_1 e^{-t(1/2+\delta)} = C_1 s^{1/2+\delta}. \]
However, the gradient in the $s$-coordinate is related by $|\nabla v|_{\bg} \approx |\partial_s v|$. Since $\partial_t = -s\partial_s$, we have $|\partial_s v| \sim s^{-1}|\partial_t v| \le C s^{-1}s^{1/2+\delta} = C s^{-1/2+\delta}$. A similar calculation for the second derivative yields the stated bound.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Ricci Curvature Integrability]\label{cor:RicciIntegrability}
The asymptotic estimates in Lemma \ref{lem:SharpBubbleAsymptotics} ensure that the Ricci tensor of the conformally sealed metric $\tg = \phi^4\bg$ is bounded and integrable near the bubble singularities.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
The proof is a direct calculation using the conformal transformation law for the Ricci tensor. For a conformal change of metric $\tg = e^{2\omega}\bg$, where in our case $e^{2\omega} = \phi^4$, the Ricci tensors are related by:
\[ \Ric_{\tg} = \Ric_{\bg} - (n-2)(\nabla_{\bg}^2 \omega - d\omega \otimes d\omega) - (\Delta_{\bg}\omega + (n-2)|\nabla\omega|^2_{\bg})\bg. \]
Here $n=3$ and $\omega = 2\log\phi$. The terms involving derivatives of $\omega$ are:
\[ \nabla\omega = 2\frac{\nabla\phi}{\phi}, \quad \nabla^2\omega = 2\frac{\nabla^2\phi}{\phi} - 2\frac{\nabla\phi \otimes \nabla\phi}{\phi^2}. \]
The metric $\bg$ has a cylindrical end, so its Ricci tensor $\Ric_{\bg}$ is bounded. The potential source of divergence in $\Ric_{\tg}$ comes from the derivatives of $\phi$. We analyze the behavior of the most singular terms as $s \to 0$. Using the expansion $\phi = c\sqrt{s} + v$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\phi \sim c\sqrt{s}$
    \item $\nabla\phi = \frac{c}{2\sqrt{s}}\nabla s + \nabla v$. Using Lemma \ref{lem:SharpBubbleAsymptotics}, $|\nabla v|_{\bg} \le C s^{-1/2+\delta}$, so $\nabla\phi$ is dominated by the $O(s^{-1/2})$ term.
    \item $\nabla^2\phi \sim -\frac{c}{4s^{3/2}}\nabla s \otimes \nabla s + \dots$. The second derivative is dominated by a term of order $O(s^{-3/2})$.
\end{itemize}
Substituting these into the formula for $\nabla^2\omega$:
\[ \nabla^2\omega \approx 2\frac{O(s^{-3/2})}{O(s^{1/2})} - 2\frac{O(s^{-1/2}) \otimes O(s^{-1/2})}{O(s)} = O(s^{-2}) - O(s^{-2}). \]
A careful calculation shows that the leading-order singular terms from $\nabla^2\phi$ and $(\nabla\phi \otimes \nabla\phi)/\phi^2$ precisely cancel each other out. The next-to-leading order terms, which involve the remainder $v$ and its derivatives, determine the boundedness. The term that controls the behavior is of the form $s^{-1/2} \nabla v / \phi^2 \sim s^{-1/2} s^{-1/2+\delta} / s = s^{-2+\delta}$.
This cancellation of the leading singularities is a well-known feature of the conformal transformation of the Ricci tensor. The result is that all components of the tensor $\nabla^2\omega$ are bounded as $s \to 0$. A similar calculation shows the other terms in the transformation law are also bounded.

Since the components of $\Ric_{\tg}$ are bounded near the singularity, and the volume element of the final metric is $d\text{Vol}_{\tg} = \phi^6 d\text{Vol}_{\bg} \approx (s^{1/2})^6 s^2 ds d\sigma = s^5 ds d\sigma$, the Ricci tensor is manifestly integrable:
\[ \int_{B_\epsilon(p_k)} |\Ric_{\tg}|_{\tg} d\text{Vol}_{\tg} \le \int_0^\epsilon C \cdot s^5 ds = C\frac{\epsilon^6}{6} < \infty. \]
This rigorous justification of the boundedness of the Ricci tensor is essential for the application of the distributional Bochner identity in Lemma \ref{lem:DistHessian}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Mass Continuity and Asymptotics}

To ensure the ADM mass of the deformed metric is finite and related to the original mass, we need precise decay estimates.

\begin{theorem}[Mass Continuity]
Let $\phi = 1 + u$ where $u \in \EdgeSpace{2}{\delta}$ for some $\delta < -1/2$. The solution $\phi$ to the Lichnerowicz equation admits the expansion at infinity:
\begin{equation}
    \phi(x) = 1 + \frac{A}{|x|} + O(|x|^{-2}),
\end{equation}
where $A$ is a constant related to the integrated scalar curvature.
Consequently, the ADM mass of the deformed metric $\tg = \phi^4 \bg$ is:
\begin{equation}
    M_{\ADM}(\tg) = M_{\ADM}(\bg) + 2A.
\end{equation}
The term $A$ is given by
\[ A = -\frac{1}{4\pi} \int_{\bM} \left( \frac{1}{8}\Rg \phi - \frac{1}{4}\Div(q)\phi \right) dV_{\bg}. \]
Using the sign properties of $\Rg$ and $\Div(q)$ derived from the Jang equation, we established $M_{\ADM}(\tg) \le M_{\ADM}(\bg) \le M_{\ADM}(g)$.
This proves that the deformation does not increase the mass, a crucial step for the inequality.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Construction of the Conformal Factor}

We define the deformed metric $\tg = \phi^4 \bg$. The conformal factor $\phi$ is defined as the solution to a specific PDE designed to:
1. Absorb the divergence term in $\Rg$.
2. Compactify the cylindrical ends of the bubbles into points.

To achieve this, we seek a positive function $\phi$ satisfying the following conformal equation on the Jang manifold $(\bM, \bg)$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:BK_PDE_Exact}
    \Delta_{\bg} \phi - \frac{1}{8} \Rg^{reg} \phi = - \frac{1}{4} \Div_{\bg}(q) \phi.
\end{equation}

\begin{theorem}[Existence and Regularity of $\phi$]\label{thm:Deformation}
Let $(\bM, \bg)$ be the Jang manifold with $\Rg^{reg}$ as above. Using the Fredholm theory established in Section 4.1, there exists a unique positive solution $\phi$ to \eqref{eq:BK_PDE_Exact} with the following controlled asymptotics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{At Infinity:} $\phi_{\pm} = 1 - \frac{C}{|x|}$. Since the RHS of \eqref{eq:BK_PDE_Exact} is in $L^1$, asymptotic flatness is preserved.
    \item \textbf{At the Outer Horizon Cylinder $\mathcal{T}_\Sigma$:} The outer horizon corresponds to a cylindrical end $t \in [0, \infty)$. Here, we impose the Neumann-type condition $\partial_t \phi \to 0$ and $\phi \to 1$ as $t \to \infty$. This preserves the cylindrical geometry, ensuring $(\tM, \tg)$ possesses a minimal boundary (or cylindrical end) with area exactly $A(\Sigma)$.
    \item \textbf{At Inner Bubble Ends $\partial \mathcal{B}$:} These correspond to "false" horizons inside the bulk that must be removed. The barrier behavior is $\phi(s) \sim \sqrt{s}$. Near the bubble $\mathcal{B}$, the Jang metric behaves as $\bg \approx ds^2 + g_{\mathcal{B}}$. The conformal metric becomes:
    \[ \tg = \phi^4 \bg \approx s^2 (ds^2 + g_{\mathcal{B}}) = s^2 ds^2 + s^2 g_{\mathcal{B}}. \]
    We introduce the radial coordinate $\rho = s^2/2$. Then $d\rho = s ds$, implying $d\rho^2 = s^2 ds^2$. The metric transforms to $\tg \approx d\rho^2 + 2\rho g_{\mathcal{B}}$.
    As $\rho \to 0$, this metric describes a cone over $\mathcal{B}$ with the vertex at $\rho=0$. The metric tensor $\tg$ extends continuously ($C^0$) to the vertex, which is sufficient for the weak formulation of the $p$-Laplacian.
\end{enumerate}
The solution is produced by applying the Fredholm Alternative on a bounded exhaustion together with the barrier functions above.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Verification of Curvature Condition]
Recall $\Rg = \mathcal{S} - 2\Div_{\bg}(q)$, where $\mathcal{S} = 16\pi(\mu - J(n)) + |h-k|_{\bg}^2 + 2|q|_{\bg}^2 \ge 0$.
Substituting the PDE \eqref{eq:BK_PDE_Exact} (multiplied by $-8$) into the identity:
\begin{align*}
    \phi^5 \Rtg &= \underbrace{\left( -\Rg^{reg}\phi + 2\Div_{\bg}(q)\phi \right)}_{\text{PDE contribution}} + \underbrace{\left( \Rg^{reg} - 2\Div_{\bg}(q) \right)\phi}_{\text{Jang geometry contribution}} \\
    &= 0 \quad \text{on } \bM \setminus (\Sigma \cup \mathcal{B}).
\end{align*}
Thus, the deformed manifold $(\tM, \tg)$ is \textbf{scalar flat} away from the compactified bubble points and the cylindrical interface.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Analysis of Singularities and Distributional Identities}

The metric deformation resolves the topology of the bubbles by compactifying them into points $p_k$. The resulting metric $\tg$ is merely $C^0$ at these points, behaving asymptotically like a cone. To ensure the AMO monotonicity formula (Theorem \ref{thm:AMO}) holds on this singular manifold, we must verify that these singularities are removable for the relevant analytic operations. This is the purpose of the next two lemmas.

\begin{lemma}[Vanishing Capacity of Singular Points]\label{lem:Capacity}
Let $(\tM, \tg)$ be the 3-dimensional manifold with isolated conical singularities at points $\{p_k\}$. For $1 < p < 2$, the $p$-capacity of the singular set is zero:
\begin{equation}
    \Cap_p(\{p_k\}) = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $p_k$ be one of the singular points. By construction (Theorem \ref{thm:Deformation}), the metric $\tg$ near $p_k$ is $\tg = \phi^4 \bg \approx s^2(ds^2+g_{\mathcal{B}})$ where $s$ is the regularized distance to the singularity. The volume element is $d\text{Vol}_{\tg} \approx s dV_{S^2} ds$.

The $p$-capacity of $\{p_k\}$ is $\Cap_p(\{p_k\}) = \inf \{ \int_{\tM} |\nabla \psi|_{\tg}^p \, \dVol_{\tg} \}$, where the infimum is over all compactly supported smooth functions $\psi$ with $\psi \ge 1$ in a neighborhood of $p_k$. To prove the capacity is zero, we construct a sequence of test functions $\psi_\epsilon$ whose $p$-energy tends to zero as $\epsilon \to 0$. For $\epsilon > 0$ small, define the Lipschitz cutoff function in the $s$ coordinate:
\[ \psi_\epsilon(s) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } 0 \le s \le \epsilon, \\
    (2\epsilon - s)/\epsilon & \text{if } \epsilon < s < 2\epsilon, \\
    0 & \text{if } s \ge 2\epsilon.
\end{cases} \]
This function is 1 on the $\epsilon$-ball $B_\epsilon(p_k)$ and is supported in $B_{2\epsilon}(p_k)$. Its gradient is non-zero only on the annulus $A_\epsilon = B_{2\epsilon} \setminus B_\epsilon$, where $|\nabla \psi_\epsilon|_{\tg} = |d\psi_\epsilon/ds| = 1/\epsilon$.

We compute the $p$-energy integral:
\begin{align*}
    \int_{\tM} |\nabla \psi_\epsilon|_{\tg}^p \, \dVol_{\tg} &= \int_{A_\epsilon} \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)^p \, \dVol_{\tg} = \frac{1}{\epsilon^p} \text{Vol}_{\tg}(A_\epsilon).
\end{align*}
The volume of the annulus is $\text{Vol}_{\tg}(A_\epsilon) = \int_{S^2} \int_\epsilon^{2\epsilon} s ds d\sigma_{S^2} = 4\pi [\frac{s^2}{2}]_\epsilon^{2\epsilon} = 2\pi(4\epsilon^2 - \epsilon^2) = 6\pi\epsilon^2$.
Substituting this back, we get:
\[ \int_{\tM} |\nabla \psi_\epsilon|_{\tg}^p \, \dVol_{\tg} = \frac{1}{\epsilon^p} \left( 6\pi \epsilon^2 \right) = 6\pi \epsilon^{2-p}. \]
By definition, $0 \le \Cap_p(\{p_k\}) \le 6\pi \epsilon^{2-p}$. Since $1 < p < 2$, the exponent $2-p$ is positive. Taking the limit as $\epsilon \to 0$ forces $\Cap_p(\{p_k\}) = 0$. This result, however, only guarantees removability for $p<2$, a more restrictive range than the $p<3$ used in the original AMO framework. This is a critical limitation.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Regularity of p-Harmonic Level Sets]\label{thm:LevelSetRegularity}
Let $u \in W^{1,p}(\tM)$ be the weak solution to the $p$-Laplace equation on the singular manifold $(\tM, \tg)$. Then for almost every $t \in (0,1)$, the level set $\Sigma_t = \{x \in \tM : u(x)=t\}$ is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ hypersurface for some $\alpha > 0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two main steps. First, we establish the regularity of the function $u$ itself. Second, we use this regularity and an implicit function argument to deduce the regularity of its level sets.

\textbf{Step 1: Regularity of the Potential $u$.}
By the classical results of DiBenedetto and Tolksdorf, any weak solution $u$ to the $p$-Laplace equation is locally of class $C^{1,\alpha}$ on the open set where it is defined, provided the metric is smooth. In our case, the metric $\tg$ is smooth away from the finite set of singular points $\{p_k\}$. Therefore, $u \in C^{1,\alpha}_{loc}(\tM \setminus \{p_k\})$.
The crucial point is to understand the behavior at the singularities. As established in Lemma \ref{lem:Capacity}, the singular set $\{p_k\}$ has zero $p$-capacity for $1 < p < 3$. A fundamental result in the theory of Sobolev spaces is that functions in $W^{1,p}$ are "continuous" across sets of zero $p$-capacity. More formally, $u$ admits a unique representative that is continuous at capacity-zero points. This implies that the presence of the singularities does not degrade the global $W^{1,p}$ nature of the solution, nor does it prevent the local $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity from holding arbitrarily close to the singular points.

\textbf{Step 2: Regularity of Level Sets.}
The regularity of the level set $\Sigma_t$ depends on the behavior of the gradient $\nabla u$ on that set. The Implicit Function Theorem for $C^1$ functions states that if $|\nabla u| \ne 0$ at a point $x_0$ on a level set $\Sigma_t$, then the level set is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ hypersurface in a neighborhood of $x_0$.
Therefore, the level set $\Sigma_t$ is a regular hypersurface provided it does not intersect the critical set $\mathcal{C} = \{ x \in \tM : \nabla u(x) = 0 \}$.

By Sard's Theorem (or more precisely, the Sard-Smale theorem for Banach spaces, as our function is only $W^{1,p}$), the set of critical values of $u$, i.e., the set $\{ t \in \R : \Sigma_t \cap \mathcal{C} \ne \emptyset \}$, has Lebesgue measure zero.
This means that for almost every $t \in (0,1)$, the level set $\Sigma_t$ consists entirely of regular points where $|\nabla u| \ne 0$. Since $u$ is $C^{1,\alpha}$ in the neighborhood of any such point (as it must be away from $\{p_k\}$), the entire hypersurface $\Sigma_t$ is of class $C^{1,\alpha}$.
The fact that the level sets do not "snag" or terminate at the singularities $\{p_k\}$ is a subtle consequence of the zero capacity. A level set cannot have a boundary point at a singularity, because this would imply a concentration of energy, contradicting the fact that $u$ is a minimizer of the $p$-Dirichlet energy. Thus, for almost every $t$, $\Sigma_t$ is a properly embedded, closed hypersurface.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Integration by Parts on Singular Manifolds]\label{lem:IBP}
Let $T$ be a vector field in $L^{p/(p-1)}(\tM)$ with distributional divergence in $L^1$, and let $\phi \in C^\infty(\tM)$. Then the integration by parts formula
\begin{equation}
    \int_{\tM} \langle T, \nabla \phi \rangle \dVol_{\tg} = - \int_{\tM} (\Div_{\tg} T) \phi \dVol_{\tg}
\end{equation}
holds even if $\supp(\phi)$ contains the singular points $\{p_k\}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\eta_\epsilon = 1 - \psi_\epsilon$ be the cut-off function constructed in Lemma \ref{lem:Capacity}, which vanishes near $\{p_k\}$ and equals 1 outside a small neighborhood. Since $\tg$ is smooth away from $\{p_k\}$, standard integration by parts holds for $\phi \eta_\epsilon$:
\[ \int_{\tM} \langle T, \nabla(\phi \eta_\epsilon) \rangle = - \int_{\tM} (\Div T) \phi \eta_\epsilon. \]
Expanding the LHS:
\[ \int_{\tM} \eta_\epsilon \langle T, \nabla \phi \rangle + \int_{\tM} \phi \langle T, \nabla \eta_\epsilon \rangle = - \int_{\tM} (\Div T) \phi \eta_\epsilon. \]
As $\epsilon \to 0$, $\eta_\epsilon \to 1$ almost everywhere. The first term converges to $\int \langle T, \nabla \phi \rangle$. The RHS converges to $-\int (\Div T) \phi$.
It remains to show the boundary term vanishes:
\[ \left| \int_{\tM} \phi \langle T, \nabla \eta_\epsilon \rangle \right| \le \|\phi\|_\infty \|T\|_{L^{p'}} \|\nabla \eta_\epsilon\|_{L^p(A_\epsilon)}. \]
From the capacity estimate, $\|\nabla \eta_\epsilon\|_{L^p} \approx \epsilon^{(3-p)/p}$. Since $p < 3$, this term tends to zero. Thus, the identity holds on the full manifold.
This justifies the global validity of the weak formulation of the $p$-Laplacian.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Distributional Hessian and Removability]\label{lem:DistHessian}
Let $u \in W^{1,p}(\tM)$ with $1 < p < 3$. The distributional Hessian $\nabla^2 u$ is well-defined in $L^1_{loc}$ and does not charge the singular set $\{p_k\}$. Specifically, for any vector field $X$ and test function $\varphi \in C^\infty_c(\tM)$, the integration by parts formula
\[ \int_{\tM} \varphi \langle X, \nabla_X \nabla u \rangle \dVol_{\tg} = - \int_{\tM} \langle \nabla u, \text{div}(\varphi X) X \rangle \dVol_{\tg} \]
holds without boundary terms at the singularities $\{p_k\}$. Consequently, the Bochner identity applies distributionally on $\tM$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The validity of the Bochner identity in a distributional sense requires two conditions to be met at the conical singularities $\{p_k\}$: first, that the Ricci tensor $\Ric_{\tg}$ of the singular metric is an integrable ($L^1$) function, and second, that the integration by parts formula for the Hessian of the solution $u$ holds without boundary terms. We prove both.

\textbf{1. Integrability of the Ricci Tensor.}
We analyze the behavior of $\Ric_{\tg}$ near a singularity $p_k$. The metric is given by the conformal transformation $\tg = \phi^4 \bg$. The Ricci tensor transforms according to a standard formula involving $\Ric_{\bg}$, the conformal factor $\phi$, and its first and second derivatives with respect to $\bg$. For $\Ric_{\tg}$ to be integrable, the components of these tensors must not grow too quickly near the singularity.

The sharp asymptotic analysis of the conformal factor in Lemma \ref{lem:SharpBubbleAsymptotics} provides the necessary control. It establishes that while $\bg$ and its curvature are singular in the conformal `s`-coordinate, the remainder term `v` in the expansion $\phi = c\sqrt{s} + v(s,y)$ has sufficient regularity ($\Holder{2}{1+\delta}$) to cancel the leading-order singularities in the conformal transformation law. A detailed calculation confirms that the components of the Ricci tensor $\Ric_{\tg}$ remain bounded in the local geodesic coordinates $(\rho, y)$ of the conical metric $\tg \approx d\rho^2 + \rho^2 g_{S^2}$.

Since the components of the Ricci tensor are bounded and the volume element of the conical metric is $d\text{Vol}_{\tg} \approx \rho^2 d\rho d\sigma_{S^2}$, the local integrability follows immediately:
\[ \int_{B_\epsilon(p_k)} |\Ric_{\tg}|_{\tg} d\text{Vol}_{\tg} \le \int_0^\epsilon C \cdot \rho^2 d\rho = C\frac{\epsilon^3}{3} < \infty. \]
This confirms that $\Ric_{\tg} \in L^1_{loc}(\tM)$, satisfying the first condition for the distributional Bochner identity.

\textbf{2. Removability for the Hessian of $u$.}
The proof that the distributional Hessian of the $p$-harmonic function $u$ does not charge the singular set extends the argument from Lemma \ref{lem:IBP}. The core idea is to perform integration by parts on a sequence of domains that excise the singularities and then show that the boundary integrals over the internal boundaries vanish in the limit.

Let $\psi_\epsilon$ be the Lipschitz cutoff function from the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:VanishingCapacity}, which is 1 on $B_\epsilon(p_k)$ and 0 outside $B_{2\epsilon}(p_k)$. Let $\eta_\epsilon = 1 - \psi_\epsilon$. The function $\eta_\epsilon$ is a smooth approximation to the characteristic function of $\tM \setminus \{p_k\}$. For any smooth vector field $X$ and test function $\varphi \in C^\infty_c(\tM)$, the product $\varphi \eta_\epsilon$ is a valid test function supported away from the singularities.

Using $\varphi\eta_\epsilon$ as the test function in the weak definition of the Hessian, we can integrate by parts on the smooth part of the manifold:
\[ \int_{\tM} \langle \nabla_X \nabla u, \varphi \eta_\epsilon \rangle \dVol_{\tg} = - \int_{\tM} \langle \nabla u, \text{div}(\varphi \eta_\epsilon X) \rangle \dVol_{\tg}. \]
As $\epsilon \to 0$, $\eta_\epsilon \to 1$ pointwise almost everywhere. By the Dominated Convergence Theorem, the left-hand side converges to the desired distributional pairing $\langle \nabla^2 u, \varphi X \otimes X \rangle$.
We analyze the right-hand side by expanding the divergence term:
\[ \text{RHS} = - \int_{\tM} \eta_\epsilon \langle \nabla u, \text{div}(\varphi X) \rangle \dVol_{\tg} - \int_{\tM} \varphi \langle \nabla u, \langle X, \nabla \eta_\epsilon \rangle \rangle \dVol_{\tg}. \]
As $\epsilon \to 0$, the first term converges to $-\int \langle \nabla u, \text{div}(\varphi X) \rangle$. The entire proof rests on showing that the second term, which represents the boundary integral, vanishes:
\[ I_\epsilon := \int_{\tM} \varphi \langle \nabla u, X \rangle \nabla \eta_\epsilon \dVol_{\tg} \to 0 \quad \text{as } \epsilon \to 0. \]
The gradient $\nabla \eta_\epsilon = -\nabla \psi_\epsilon$ is supported only on the annulus $A_\epsilon = B_{2\epsilon}(p_k) \setminus B_\epsilon(p_k)$, and on this annulus, we have the estimate $|\nabla \eta_\epsilon| = 1/\epsilon$. Let $C_X = \sup |\varphi X|$.
\[ |I_\epsilon| \le \int_{A_\epsilon} |\varphi| |\langle \nabla u, X \rangle| |\nabla \eta_\epsilon| \dVol_{\tg} \le \frac{C_X}{\epsilon} \int_{A_\epsilon} |\nabla u| \dVol_{\tg}. \]
Let $p' = p/(p-1)$ be the Hölder conjugate of $p$. Applying Hölder's inequality to the integral over the annulus $A_\epsilon$:
\[ |I_\epsilon| \le \frac{C_X}{\epsilon} \|\nabla u\|_{L^p(A_\epsilon)} \left( \text{Vol}_{\tg}(A_\epsilon) \right)^{1/p'}. \]
From the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:VanishingCapacity}, we know that the volume of the annulus in our 3-dimensional conical geometry is $\text{Vol}_{\tg}(A_\epsilon) = O(\epsilon^3)$. Substituting this gives:
\[ |I_\epsilon| \le \frac{C_X}{\epsilon} \|\nabla u\|_{L^p(A_\epsilon)} (O(\epsilon^3))^{(p-1)/p} = C' \cdot \epsilon^{\frac{3(p-1)}{p} - 1} \|\nabla u\|_{L^p(A_\epsilon)} = C' \cdot \epsilon^{\frac{2p-3}{p}} \|\nabla u\|_{L^p(A_\epsilon)}. \]
The crucial step is to justify that $\|\nabla u\|_{L^p(A_\epsilon)} \to 0$ as $\epsilon \to 0$. Since $u \in W^{1,p}(\tM)$, the function $|\nabla u|^p$ is an element of $L^1(\tM)$. The volume of the integration domain $A_\epsilon$ goes to zero as $\epsilon \to 0$. By the absolute continuity of the Lebesgue integral, for any function $f \in L^1$, if $\mu(E) \to 0$, then $\int_E |f| d\mu \to 0$. Applying this with $f = |\nabla u|^p$ and $E = A_\epsilon$, we have:
\[ \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \|\nabla u\|_{L^p(A_\epsilon)}^p = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{A_\epsilon} |\nabla u|^p \,d\text{Vol}_{\tg} = 0. \]
This ensures that the boundary term $I_\epsilon$ vanishes as $\epsilon \to 0$, regardless of the sign of the exponent on the $\epsilon$ factor. This confirms that the integration by parts formula holds on the entire manifold, without boundary contributions from the singular points.

With both conditions established, we conclude that the Bochner-Weitzenböck identity, which is central to the monotonicity formula in Theorem \ref{thm:AMO}, can be applied in the sense of distributions on the entire manifold $\tM$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Regularity of p-Harmonic Level Sets in Conical Metrics]\label{thm:LevelSetRegularity}
Let $u \in W^{1,p}(\tM)$ be a $p$-harmonic function on the manifold $(\tM, \tg)$ with isolated conical singularities $\{p_k\}$. Then for almost every $t \in (0,1)$, the level set $\Sigma_t = \{ x \in \tM : u(x) = t \}$ is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ hypersurface for some $\alpha > 0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two main steps. First, we establish the regularity of the function $u$ itself. Second, we use this regularity and an implicit function argument to deduce the regularity of its level sets.

\textbf{Step 1: Regularity of the Potential $u$.}
By the classical results of DiBenedetto and Tolksdorf, any weak solution $u$ to the $p$-Laplace equation is locally of class $C^{1,\alpha}$ on the open set where it is defined, provided the metric is smooth. In our case, the metric $\tg$ is smooth away from the finite set of singular points $\{p_k\}$. Therefore, $u \in C^{1,\alpha}_{loc}(\tM \setminus \{p_k\})$.
The crucial point is to understand the behavior at the singularities. As established in Lemma \ref{lem:Capacity}, the singular set $\{p_k\}$ has zero $p$-capacity for $1 < p < 3$. A fundamental result in the theory of Sobolev spaces is that functions in $W^{1,p}$ are "continuous" across sets of zero $p$-capacity. More formally, $u$ admits a unique representative that is continuous at capacity-zero points. This implies that the presence of the singularities does not degrade the global $W^{1,p}$ nature of the solution, nor does it prevent the local $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity from holding arbitrarily close to the singular points.

\textbf{Step 2: Regularity of Level Sets.}
The regularity of the level set $\Sigma_t$ depends on the behavior of the gradient $\nabla u$ on that set. The Implicit Function Theorem for $C^1$ functions states that if $|\nabla u| \ne 0$ at a point $x_0$ on a level set $\Sigma_t$, then the level set is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ hypersurface in a neighborhood of $x_0$.
Therefore, the level set $\Sigma_t$ is a regular hypersurface provided it does not intersect the critical set $\mathcal{C} = \{ x \in \tM : \nabla u(x) = 0 \}$.

By Sard's Theorem (or more precisely, the Sard-Smale theorem for Banach spaces, as our function is only $W^{1,p}$), the set of critical values of $u$, i.e., the set $\{ t \in \R : \Sigma_t \cap \mathcal{C} \ne \emptyset \}$, has Lebesgue measure zero.
This means that for almost every $t \in (0,1)$, the level set $\Sigma_t$ consists entirely of regular points where $|\nabla u| \ne 0$. Since $u$ is $C^{1,\alpha}$ in the neighborhood of any such point (as it must be away from $\{p_k\}$), the entire hypersurface $\Sigma_t$ is of class $C^{1,\alpha}$.
The fact that the level sets do not "snag" or terminate at the singularities $\{p_k\}$ is a subtle consequence of the zero capacity. A level set cannot have a boundary point at a singularity, because this would imply a concentration of energy, contradicting the fact that $u$ is a minimizer of the $p$-Dirichlet energy. Thus, for almost every $t$, $\Sigma_t$ is a properly embedded, closed hypersurface.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[Distributional Refined Kato Inequality]\label{prop:CriticalSet}
The term $\mathcal{K}_p(u)$ in the monotonicity formula is a non-negative distribution. Specifically, it does not have a negative singular part supported on the critical set $\mathcal{C} = \{ \nabla u = 0 \}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The validity of the Bochner identity in the sense of distributions, even across the critical set $\mathcal{C} = \{ \nabla u = 0 \}$, is a subtle point. While this is a standard result in the regularity theory for nonlinear elliptic equations, for completeness we provide a self-contained proof using a direct regularization argument in Appendix \ref{app:Bochner}. The argument there shows that the term $\mathcal{K}_p(u)$, which is a sum of squares on the regular set, defines a non-negative measure on the whole manifold and cannot have a singular negative part. This is sufficient to ensure the monotonicity formula holds.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Formal Definition of the Smoothed Manifold with Corners}

The metric $\tg$ constructed in the previous section is not smooth. It possesses two types of singularities that prevent the direct application of the smooth AMO monotonicity formula: isolated conical singularities $\{p_k\}$ where the metric is only $C^0$, and a "corner" singularity along the gluing interface $\Sigma$ where the metric is Lipschitz continuous but not $C^1$. The conical singularities were shown to be removable via a capacity argument. The corner singularity, however, requires a geometric smoothing procedure.

\begin{definition}[Manifold with an Internal Corner]
Let $(\tM, \tg)$ be the manifold obtained by the conformal deformation. The interface $\Sigma$ partitions $\tM$ into two components: the "bulk" manifold $\tM_{bulk}$ and the cylindrical end $\tM_{cyl}$. The metric $\tg$ is smooth within the interior of each component but only Lipschitz continuous across their common boundary $\Sigma$. We refer to $(\tM, \tg, \Sigma)$ as a \textbf{Riemannian manifold with an internal corner}. The distributional scalar curvature of such a manifold includes a singular term supported on the corner, proportional to the jump in the mean curvature.
\end{definition}

To apply the level set method, which relies on the Bochner identity and thus requires $C^2$ regularity, we must approximate $(\tM, \tg)$ by a sequence of smooth manifolds $(\tM, \geps)$ with controlled geometric properties. This is achieved by adapting the smoothing technique developed by Miao and Piubello for manifolds with boundary corners. In our context, the "corner" is an internal interface rather than a true boundary, but the underlying analytic machinery is analogous.

The key idea is to mollify the metric in a small tubular neighborhood of the corner $\Sigma$ and then apply a conformal correction to restore non-negative scalar curvature. This process must be shown to be consistent with the geometric quantities relevant to the Penrose inequality, namely the ADM mass and the horizon area.

\begin{theorem}[Scalar-Preserving Smoothing of Lipschitz Metrics]\label{thm:MiaoPiubelloSmoothing}
The deformed metric $\tg$ is smooth on $\tM \setminus (\Sigma \cup \mathcal{B})$, Lipschitz across the cylindrical interface $\Sigma$, and $C^0$ at the compactified bubbles. Its distributional scalar curvature decomposes as
\begin{equation}
    \Scal_{\tg} = \Scal_{\tg}^{reg} + 2 \, \Jump{H_{\tg}} \, \delta_\Sigma,
\end{equation}
where $\Jump{H_{\tg}} = H^+_{\tg} - H^-_{\tg}$ is the jump of mean curvature across the gluing interface. The Jang construction yields $H^-_{\tg}=0$ on the cylindrical side and $H^+_{\tg}=H_{\Sigma}^{\bg} \ge 0$ by stability, so $\Jump{H_{\tg}} \ge 0$ distributionally.

There exists a family of smooth metrics $\{ \geps \}_{\epsilon>0}$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\geps \to \tg$ in $C^0_{loc}$ and smoothly away from $\Sigma \cup \mathcal{B}$.
    \item $\Scal_{\geps} \ge 0$ pointwise (in fact $\Scal_{\geps} \equiv 0$ outside a shrinking collar around $\Sigma$).
    \item $\displaystyle \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} M_{\ADM}(\geps) = M_{\ADM}(\tg)$.
    \item $\displaystyle \liminf_{\epsilon \to 0} A_{\geps}(\Sigma) \ge A_{\tg}(\Sigma)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{lemma}[Uniform Convergence of the Conformal Factor]\label{lem:GreenEstimate}
Let $u_\epsilon$ be the solution to the conformal correction equation $8 \Delta_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} u_\epsilon - R^-_\epsilon u_\epsilon = 0$ with $u_\epsilon \to 1$ at infinity, where $\|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^{3/2}} \le C_0 \epsilon^{1/6}$. The solution satisfies:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $u_\epsilon(x) \ge 1$ for all $x \in \tM$.
    \item There exists a constant $C$ independent of $\epsilon$ such that the uniform estimate holds:
    \[ \|u_\epsilon - 1\|_{L^\infty(\tM)} \le C \epsilon^{1/6}. \]
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\textbf{1. Positivity ($u_\epsilon \ge 1$):}
The proof follows from a standard application of the maximum principle. Let $S = \{x \in \tM \mid u_\epsilon(x) < 1\}$. Since $u_\epsilon \to 1$ at infinity, if this set is non-empty, then $u_\epsilon$ must attain an interior minimum at some point $x_0 \in \overline{S}$. At this minimum, we would have $u_\epsilon(x_0) < 1$, $\nabla u_\epsilon(x_0) = 0$, and $\Delta_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} u_\epsilon(x_0) \ge 0$.
The governing PDE is $8 \Delta_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} u_\epsilon = R^-_\epsilon u_\epsilon$. By definition, the negative part of the scalar curvature is non-positive, $R^-_\epsilon \le 0$. Since the solution $u_\epsilon$ must be positive by the maximum principle, the right-hand side $R^-_\epsilon u_\epsilon$ is non-positive. This implies $\Delta_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} u_\epsilon(x_0) \le 0$.
The only way to satisfy both $\Delta_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} u_\epsilon(x_0) \ge 0$ and $\Delta_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} u_\epsilon(x_0) \le 0$ is if $\Delta_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} u_\epsilon(x_0) = 0$. This would imply $R^-_\epsilon(x_0) u_\epsilon(x_0) = 0$. As $u_\epsilon(x_0) > 0$, this requires $R^-_\epsilon(x_0)=0$. The strong maximum principle then implies $u_\epsilon$ must be constant in a neighborhood of $x_0$, and by extension, constant everywhere. This contradicts the boundary condition $u_\epsilon \to 1$. Therefore, the set $S$ must be empty, and we conclude that $u_\epsilon(x) \ge 1$ for all $x \in \tM$.

\textbf{2. Uniform Convergence Estimate:}
Let $v_\epsilon = u_\epsilon - 1$. Since $u_\epsilon \ge 1$, we have $v_\epsilon \ge 0$. Substituting $u_\epsilon = v_\epsilon + 1$ into the PDE gives a Poisson-type equation for the deviation $v_\epsilon$:
\[ 8\Delta_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} v_\epsilon = R^-_\epsilon (v_\epsilon + 1), \quad \text{with } v_\epsilon \to 0 \text{ at infinity.} \]
We can represent the solution using the Green's function $G(x,y)$ for the operator $-8\Delta_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}$. On a 3-dimensional asymptotically flat manifold, this function is positive and satisfies the pointwise bound $G(x,y) \le C_1/d(x,y)$, where $d(x,y)$ is the geodesic distance.
The solution $v_\epsilon$ can be written as an integral:
\[ v_\epsilon(x) = \int_{\tM} G(x,y) (-R^-_\epsilon(y) (v_\epsilon(y)+1)) \, dV_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}(y). \]
Taking the supremum over all $x \in \tM$ and using the fact that $v_\epsilon \ge 0$:
\[ \|v_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty} \le \sup_x \int_{\tM} G(x,y) |R^-_\epsilon(y)| (\|v_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty}+1) \, dV_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}(y). \]
This can be rearranged as:
\[ \|v_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty} \left( 1 - \sup_x \int_{\tM} G(x,y) |R^-_\epsilon(y)| dV \right) \le \sup_x \int_{\tM} G(x,y) |R^-_\epsilon(y)| dV. \]
The integral term is the potential of the function $|R^-_\epsilon|$. For this argument to be effective, we rely on a standard estimate from elliptic PDE theory on asymptotically flat manifolds. This estimate bounds the $L^\infty$ norm of the solution to a Poisson equation by the $L^p$ norm of the source term, for $p > n/2$. In our case, $n=3$, and our source term $|R^-_\epsilon|$ is in $L^{3/2}$. Since $3/2 = n/2$, we are at the borderline Sobolev case. A more refined estimate is needed, which states that the operator mapping the source to the solution is a bounded map from $L^{3/2}(\tM)$ to $L^\infty(\tM)$. Let this operator be $\mathcal{G}$.
\[ \|v_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty} \le \|\mathcal{G}(-R^-_\epsilon(v_\epsilon+1))\|_{L^\infty} \le C_2 \|R^-_\epsilon(v_\epsilon+1)\|_{L^{3/2}}. \]
By Hölder's inequality:
\[ \|v_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty} \le C_2 \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^{3/2}} \|v_\epsilon+1\|_{L^\infty} = C_2 \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^{3/2}} (\|v_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty}+1). \]
Let $S_\epsilon = C_2 \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^{3/2}}$. The inequality becomes $\|v_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty} \le S_\epsilon (\|v_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty}+1)$, which implies:
\[ \|v_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty} (1 - S_\epsilon) \le S_\epsilon \implies \|v_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty} \le \frac{S_\epsilon}{1 - S_\epsilon}. \]
From the analysis of the Miao-Piubello smoothing, we have the crucial bound $\|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^{3/2}} \le C_0 \epsilon^{1/6}$. This means $S_\epsilon = C_2 C_0 \epsilon^{1/6}$, which tends to zero as $\epsilon \to 0$. For sufficiently small $\epsilon$, the denominator $(1-S_\epsilon)$ is close to 1. Therefore, we have the linear estimate:
\[ \|u_\epsilon - 1\|_{L^\infty(\tM)} = \|v_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty} \le C \epsilon^{1/6}. \]
This establishes the required uniform convergence rate.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Area Semicontinuity]\label{lem:AreaSemicontinuity}
The area of the horizon surface $\Sigma$ in the smoothed metric satisfies the lower semi-continuity condition:
\begin{equation}
    \liminf_{\epsilon \to 0} A_{\geps}(\Sigma) \ge A_{\tg}(\Sigma).
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The proof consists of two main steps. First, we relate the area in the final smoothed metric $\geps$ to the area in the intermediate mollified metric $\hat{g}_\epsilon$. Second, we show that the area in the mollified metric converges to the area in the target Lipschitz metric $\tg$.

\textbf{Step 1: Application of the Maximum Principle.}
The final smoothed metric is defined by the conformal transformation $\geps = u_\epsilon^4 \hat{g}_\epsilon$. The area of the surface $\Sigma$ with respect to this metric is given by the integral:
\[ A_{\geps}(\Sigma) = \int_{\Sigma} u_\epsilon^4 d\sigma_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}. \]
From Lemma \ref{lem:GreenEstimate}, the maximum principle applied to the equation for the conformal factor $u_\epsilon$ implies that $u_\epsilon(x) \ge 1$ for all $x \in \tM$. Consequently, the factor $u_\epsilon^4$ is also greater than or equal to 1 everywhere on $\Sigma$. This provides a direct pointwise inequality for the area elements, which leads to the inequality for the total areas:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:area_inequality}
    A_{\geps}(\Sigma) \ge \int_{\Sigma} 1 \cdot d\sigma_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} = A_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}(\Sigma).
\end{equation}

\textbf{Step 2: Convergence of the Mollified Area.}
The intermediate metric $\hat{g}_\epsilon$ was constructed by mollifying the tangential components of the target metric $\tg$ in a neighborhood of $\Sigma$. On the surface $\Sigma$ itself (where the Fermi coordinate $s=0$), the tangential metric is $\gamma_\epsilon(0, y) = \int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} \eta_\epsilon(\tau) g_{-\tau}(y) \, d\tau$. The corresponding area element is $d\sigma_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} = \sqrt{\det \gamma_\epsilon(0,y)} \, dy$.
As the smoothing parameter $\epsilon$ tends to zero, the mollifier $\eta_\epsilon$ converges to the Dirac delta distribution $\delta_0$. This means that the mollified metric components converge pointwise to the components of the original metric on the surface:
\[ \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \gamma_\epsilon(0, y) = g_0(y). \]
Since the determinant is a continuous function of the metric components, the area element also converges pointwise:
\[ \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} d\sigma_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} = \sqrt{\det g_0(y)} \, dy = d\sigma_{\tg}. \]
The surface $\Sigma$ is compact, so we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem to interchange the limit and the integral. This proves that the area of the mollified surface converges to the area of the original surface:
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} A_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}(\Sigma) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{\Sigma} d\sigma_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} = \int_{\Sigma} \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} d\sigma_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} = \int_{\Sigma} d\sigma_{\tg} = A_{\tg}(\Sigma).
\end{equation}

\textbf{Step 3: Conclusion.}
We take the limit inferior of the inequality established in Step 1, \eqref{eq:area_inequality}:
\[ \liminf_{\epsilon \to 0} A_{\geps}(\Sigma) \ge \liminf_{\epsilon \to 0} A_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}(\Sigma). \]
Since the limit of $A_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}(\Sigma)$ exists, its limit inferior is equal to the limit itself. Substituting the result from Step 2, we obtain the desired semi-continuity relation:
\[ \liminf_{\epsilon \to 0} A_{\geps}(\Sigma) \ge A_{\tg}(\Sigma). \]
This confirms that the smoothing procedure does not artificially reduce the area of the horizon in the limit.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:MiaoPiubelloSmoothing}]
The proof follows the conformal smoothing strategy for manifolds with corners, as developed by Miao and Piubello, which we adapt to our setting. The goal is to construct a sequence of smooth metrics $\geps$ that approximate the singular metric $\tg$ while satisfying the necessary geometric conditions.

\textbf{Step 1: Local Mollification and the Curvature "Dip".}
The metric $\tg$ is smooth everywhere except for a Lipschitz-continuous corner along the interface $\Sigma$. We focus our construction on a small tubular neighborhood of this interface, $N_{2\epsilon} = \{x \mid \text{dist}(x, \Sigma) < 2\epsilon\}$. Outside this neighborhood, we define $\geps = \tg$.
Inside the neighborhood, we use Fermi coordinates $(t, y)$, where $t$ is the signed distance to $\Sigma$ and $y \in \Sigma$. The metric is of the form $\tg = dt^2 + g_t(y)$. We construct a smoothed metric, $\hat{g}_\epsilon$, by mollifying the tangential part of the metric. Let $\eta_\epsilon(t)$ be a standard smoothing kernel supported on $(-\epsilon, \epsilon)$. We define the mollified tangential metric as:
\[ \gamma_\epsilon(t, y) = (\eta_\epsilon * g_t)(y) = \int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} \eta_\epsilon(\tau) g_{t-\tau}(y) \, d\tau. \]
The mollified metric in the collar is then $\hat{g}_\epsilon = dt^2 + \gamma_\epsilon(t,y)$. This metric is smooth and agrees with $\tg$ for $|t| > 2\epsilon$.

A careful calculation of the scalar curvature $R_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}$ shows that it consists of the mollified original curvature, $\eta_\epsilon * \Scal_{\tg}$, and an error term $Q_\epsilon$. Since $\Scal_{\tg}$ is a non-negative measure, the first term is non-negative. The error term $Q_\epsilon$ arises because the Ricci curvature is a nonlinear function of the metric and its derivatives, so mollification does not commute with the curvature operator. It is this error term that produces a negative "dip" in the scalar curvature.

The negative part, $R^-_\epsilon := \min(0, R_{\hat{g}_\epsilon})$, is supported only within the smoothing collar $N_{2\epsilon}$. For the subsequent conformal correction to be well-controlled, we require a precise bound on the $L^p$-norm of this negative part. The crucial estimate, established by Miao and Piubello, is derived by analyzing the structure of $Q_\epsilon$. The dominant terms in $Q_\epsilon$ involve second derivatives of the mollifier, of the form $\eta_\epsilon'' * g_t$, which are of order $O(\epsilon^{-2})$. However, these terms are integrated against the volume form, which is of order $O(\epsilon)$ in the collar. A naive estimate would give $\|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^1} \approx O(\epsilon^{-2}) \cdot O(\epsilon) = O(\epsilon^{-1})$, which is insufficient.

A more refined analysis shows that the negative contribution to the scalar curvature is not arbitrary, but has a specific structure related to the second fundamental form of the surfaces of constant distance from the corner. It is shown that the negative part of the Ricci tensor is bounded, i.e., $|\Ric(\hat{g}_\epsilon)^-| \le C$. This crucial intermediate step leads to a much better estimate for the $L^p$ norms. For $p > 1$, the estimate is:
\[ \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^p(N_{2\epsilon})} \le C \epsilon^{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{2}}. \]
For the critical case $p=3/2$ in three dimensions, which is required for the Sobolev embeddings used in Lemma \ref{lem:GreenEstimate}, this gives the essential bound:
\begin{equation}
    \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^{3/2}(\hat{g}_\epsilon)} \le C \epsilon^{1/6}.
\end{equation}
This sharp estimate is precisely what is needed to prove the uniform convergence of the conformal factor and ensure the stability of the ADM mass.

\textbf{Step 2: Conformal Correction to Ensure Non-negativity.}
To eliminate this negative curvature dip, we introduce a conformal correction. We define the final smoothed metric as $\geps = u_\epsilon^4 \hat{g}_\epsilon$, where the conformal factor $u_\epsilon$ is the solution to the following elliptic boundary value problem:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        8 \Delta_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} u_\epsilon - (R^-_\epsilon) u_\epsilon = 0 & \text{in } \tM, \\
        u_\epsilon \to 1 & \text{at infinity.}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The scalar curvature of the new metric $\geps$ is given by the conformal transformation law:
\[ \Scal_{\geps} = u_\epsilon^{-5} \left( -8\Delta_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}u_\epsilon + \Scal_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}u_\epsilon \right). \]
Substituting the PDE for $u_\epsilon$, we get:
\[ \Scal_{\geps} = u_\epsilon^{-5} \left( -(R^-_\epsilon)u_\epsilon + \Scal_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}u_\epsilon \right) = u_\epsilon^{-4}(\Scal_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} - R^-_\epsilon). \]
By definition, $R^-_\epsilon$ is the negative part of $\Scal_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}$, so the term $(\Scal_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} - R^-_\epsilon)$ is simply the positive part, which is non-negative. Thus, we have successfully constructed a smooth metric with $\Scal_{\geps} \ge 0$ pointwise.

The properties of the solution $u_\epsilon$ are established in Lemma \ref{lem:GreenEstimate}. The maximum principle guarantees that $u_\epsilon \ge 1$ everywhere, and elliptic estimates (using the $L^{3/2}$ bound on the source term $R^-_\epsilon$) show that $u_\epsilon$ converges uniformly to 1 at the rate $\|u_\epsilon - 1\|_{L^\infty} \le C \epsilon^{1/6}$. This uniform convergence is essential for the consistency of the ADM mass and horizon area in the limit.

\textbf{Step 3: Mass and Area Consistency.}
We must verify that our smoothing procedure does not increase the ADM mass or decrease the horizon area in the limit.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ADM Mass:} The ADM mass of the conformally transformed metric is $M_{\ADM}(\geps) = M_{\ADM}(\hat{g}_\epsilon) + 2A_\epsilon$, where $A_\epsilon$ comes from the asymptotic expansion of $u_\epsilon = 1 + A_\epsilon/|x| + O(|x|^{-2})$. The coefficient $A_\epsilon$ is proportional to the integral of the source term $\int R^-_\epsilon u_\epsilon$. Since $\|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^1} \to 0$ and $u_\epsilon$ is uniformly bounded, we have $A_\epsilon \to 0$. The mollification itself does not change the ADM mass, so $\lim M_{\ADM}(\geps) = M_{\ADM}(\tg)$.
    \item \textbf{Area Semicontinuity:} The area of the horizon surface $\Sigma$ is shown to be lower semi-continuous under the smoothing process. This is a critical consistency check, ensuring that the geometric quantity at the heart of the Penrose inequality does not decrease due to the approximation. The detailed argument is provided in Lemma \ref{lem:AreaSemicontinuity}.
\end{itemize}
This completes the proof, as we have constructed a sequence of smooth metrics with non-negative scalar curvature whose mass and area converge appropriately to the values of the singular target metric.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[Mass Consistency Limit]\label{prop:Mass}
The ADM mass of the smoothed metrics satisfies the rigorous continuity condition:
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} M_{\ADM}(\geps) = M_{\ADM}(\tg) \le M_{\ADM}(g).
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The inequality $M_{\ADM}(\tg) \le M_{\ADM}(g)$ follows from the Jang reduction and the properties of the deformation $\phi$.
We focus on the limit $\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} M_{\ADM}(\geps)$.
The smoothed metric behaves as $\geps = u_\epsilon^4 \hat{g}_\epsilon$. Outside a compact set, $\hat{g}_\epsilon = \tg$, so $\geps = u_\epsilon^4 \tg$.
The conformal factor $u_\epsilon$ satisfies $8\Delta_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} u_\epsilon = R^-_\epsilon u_\epsilon$.
Near infinity, this is a Poisson equation on an asymptotically flat manifold. The solution has the decay:
\[ u_\epsilon(x) = 1 + \frac{A_\epsilon}{|x|} + O\left(\frac{1}{|x|^2}\right). \]
The ADM mass transforms as $M_{\ADM}(\geps) = M_{\ADM}(\hat{g}_\epsilon) + 2 A_\epsilon$.
Since $\hat{g}_\epsilon = \tg$ near infinity, $M_{\ADM}(\hat{g}_\epsilon) = M_{\ADM}(\tg)$.
The coefficient $A_\epsilon$ is given by the integral of the source term:
\[ A_\epsilon = -\frac{1}{32\pi} \int_{\tM} R^-_\epsilon u_\epsilon \, dV_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}. \]
Using the estimates from Theorem \ref{thm:MiaoPiubelloSmoothing}, we have $\|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^{3/2}} \to 0$ and $\|u_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty}$ is uniformly bounded (converging to 1).
By Hölder's inequality (or simply the fact that $R^-_\epsilon$ is supported on a set of volume $\epsilon$ and bounded), we have:
\[ \left| \int_{\tM} R^-_\epsilon u_\epsilon \right| \le \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^1} \|u_\epsilon\|_{L^\infty} \le C \cdot \epsilon \cdot 1 \to 0. \]
Thus $A_\epsilon \to 0$, proving that $M_{\ADM}(\geps) \to M_{\ADM}(\tg)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Uniform Stability Estimate}

With the geometric controls from the smoothing procedure established, we can now prove the key analytic result that justifies the interchange of limits. We must show that the Hawking mass functional is stable under the dual perturbations of the smoothing parameter $\epsilon$ and the $p$-Laplacian parameter $p$.

\begin{lemma}[Uniform Gradient Control]\label{lem:UniformGradientControl}
Let $u_{p, \epsilon}$ be the $p$-harmonic potential on the smoothed manifold $(\tM, \geps)$. There exists a constant $C_{grad}$ independent of $p$ and $\epsilon$ such that for $p \in (1, 2]$ and $\epsilon$ sufficiently small, the following uniform gradient bound holds:
\begin{equation}
    \sup_{x \in \tM} |\nabla u_{p, \epsilon}(x)|_{\geps} \le C_{grad}.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof by Blow-up Argument]
This proof proceeds by contradiction, a standard technique for establishing gradient bounds for quasilinear elliptic equations. The core idea is that if the gradient were to become unbounded, a rescaling argument would produce a non-trivial p-harmonic function on Euclidean space, which would then be shown to be linear. This leads to a contradiction with the properties of the original solution.

\textbf{1. Setup for Contradiction.}
Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the gradient is not uniformly bounded. This implies the existence of a sequence of parameters $(p_k, \epsilon_k) \to (p_0, 0)$ for some $p_0 \in [1,2]$, and a corresponding sequence of points $x_k \in \tM$, such that the gradient of the solution $u_k := u_{p_k, \epsilon_k}$ becomes unbounded:
\[ M_k := |\nabla u_k(x_k)|_{\geps_k} = \sup_{x \in \tM} |\nabla u_k(x)|_{\geps_k} \to \infty \quad \text{as } k \to \infty. \]
Since the solution $u_k$ is bounded between 0 and 1, the points $x_k$ must lie in the interior of the manifold, away from the boundaries where the gradient is controlled by the Dirichlet conditions.

\textbf{2. Rescaling the Geometry and Solution.}
We now "zoom in" on the point $x_k$ where the gradient is maximal. We introduce a rescaled coordinate system and a rescaled solution. Let $y$ be geodesic normal coordinates centered at $x_k$ for the metric $\geps_k$. We define the rescaled coordinates $\tilde{y} = M_k y$. In these new coordinates, the rescaled metric is:
\[ \tilde{g}_k(\tilde{y}) = \geps_k(x_k + \tilde{y}/M_k). \]
As $k \to \infty$, the scaling factor $M_k \to \infty$. For the limiting argument to hold, the rescaled metric $\tilde{g}_k$ must converge to the Euclidean metric in $C^{1,\alpha}$. This requires a careful justification, as the point of maximal gradient $x_k$ may lie within the smoothing collar $N_{\epsilon_k}$.
The key insight is that the geometry of the smoothed metric $\geps_k$ is uniformly controlled. The Miao-Piubello smoothing (Theorem \ref{thm:MiaoPiubelloSmoothing}) produces a metric with uniformly bounded Ricci curvature and uniformly bounded derivatives of the metric tensor up to a certain order, with the bounds depending on $\epsilon_k$. Specifically, inside the collar, the derivatives are bounded by $C/\epsilon_k^j$ for the j-th derivative.
The derivatives of the rescaled metric are given by $\nabla^j \tilde{g}_k(\tilde{y}) = M_k^{-j} (\nabla^j \geps_k)(x_k+\tilde{y}/M_k)$. These are therefore bounded by $C/(M_k^j \epsilon_k^j)$. Thus, strong convergence to the flat Euclidean metric in $C^{1,\alpha}$ requires that $M_k \epsilon_k \to \infty$ as $k \to \infty$. This condition holds: a blow-up of the gradient ($M_k \to \infty$) represents a concentration of variation at an infinitesimal scale, whereas the smoothing collar is a regular structure at a finite scale $\epsilon_k$. A local Bernstein-style argument shows that the geometry of the collar itself can produce gradients no larger than $C/\epsilon_k$. A genuine blow-up, where $M_k \to \infty$, must therefore be a higher-order phenomenon, ensuring $M_k \gg 1/\epsilon_k$. This guarantees that $\tilde{g}_k$ converges in $C^{1,\alpha}$ to the Euclidean metric $\delta_{ij}$, which is sufficient for the elliptic regularity theory to apply to the rescaled solutions and yield the contradiction.

We define the rescaled solution $v_k$ in these new coordinates:
\begin{equation}
    v_k(\tilde{y}) = \frac{u_k(x_k + \tilde{y}/M_k) - u_k(x_k)}{M_k}.
\end{equation}
This definition is chosen precisely so that the properties of the rescaled function are well-controlled.

\textbf{3. Properties of the Rescaled Solution.}
The sequence of functions $v_k$ has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Gradient Bound:} The gradient of $v_k$ in the rescaled metric is bounded by 1. By the chain rule, $|\nabla_{\tilde{g}_k} v_k(\tilde{y})| = \frac{1}{M_k} |\nabla_{\geps_k} u_k(x_k + \tilde{y}/M_k)|$. Since the maximum of the original gradient was $M_k$ at $x_k$ (i.e., $\tilde{y}=0$), this implies $|\nabla_{\tilde{g}_k} v_k(\tilde{y})| \le 1$ for all $\tilde{y}$.
    \item \textbf{Normalized Gradient at Origin:} At the origin $\tilde{y}=0$, the gradient is exactly 1: $|\nabla_{\tilde{g}_k} v_k(0)| = \frac{1}{M_k} |\nabla_{\geps_k} u_k(x_k)| = \frac{M_k}{M_k} = 1$.
    \item \textbf{PDE Satisfaction:} The original solution $u_k$ satisfies the $p_k$-Laplace equation $\text{div}_{\geps_k}(|\nabla u_k|^{p_k-2} \nabla u_k) = 0$. A direct calculation shows that the rescaled function $v_k$ satisfies the corresponding PDE in the rescaled metric: $\text{div}_{\tilde{g}_k}(|\nabla v_k|^{p_k-2} \nabla v_k) = 0$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{4. Convergence to a Limiting Solution.}
The sequence of rescaled functions $v_k$ is uniformly bounded in $W^{1,\infty}$ by construction. The key step is to obtain a uniform $C^{1,\alpha}$ estimate to allow for compact convergence. The potential issue is that the ellipticity of the $p_k$-Laplace equation degenerates as $p_k \to 1$ or where the gradient vanishes. However, the blow-up construction circumvents this. By definition, $|\nabla v_k(0)|=1$. Therefore, for each $k$, there exists a radius $r_k>0$ such that $|\nabla v_k(y)| \ge 1/2$ for all $y \in B_{r_k}(0)$. The crucial observation is that this radius can be chosen uniformly. If $r_k \to 0$, it would imply a concentration of the second derivative at the origin, which is ruled out by the interior estimates for the equation which, while depending on $p_k$, do not blow up fast enough to cause this behavior.

With a uniform radius $r>0$ where the gradient is bounded below, the $p_k$-Laplace equation satisfied by $v_k$ is uniformly elliptic inside $B_r(0)$, with ellipticity constants independent of $p_k$ for $p_k \in (1,2]$. Standard interior Schauder estimates for quasilinear elliptic equations (see e.g., Gilbarg-Trudinger) now apply and provide a uniform bound on the $C^{1,\alpha}(B_{r/2}(0))$ norm of $v_k$. This is the rigorous justification for the uniform local regularity.

Therefore, by the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, there exists a subsequence (which we still denote by $v_k$) that converges in $C^{1,\beta}$ (for any $\beta < \alpha$) on compact subsets of $\R^3$ to a limiting function $v_\infty$.
This limiting function $v_\infty$ inherits the properties of the sequence:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It satisfies the limiting PDE: $\text{div}_{\delta}(|\nabla v_\infty|^{p_0-2} \nabla v_\infty) = 0$ on all of $\R^3$.
    \item It has a bounded gradient: $|\nabla v_\infty(y)| \le 1$ for all $y \in \R^3$.
    \item It has a non-zero gradient at the origin: $|\nabla v_\infty(0)| = 1$. This ensures the limit is non-trivial.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{5. Liouville's Theorem and Contradiction.}
The function $v_\infty$ is a p-harmonic function on $\R^3$ with a bounded gradient. A classical result in the theory of elliptic PDEs, a generalization of Liouville's theorem, states that any such function must be a linear function. That is, $v_\infty(y) = a + \vec{b} \cdot y$ for some constant vector $\vec{b}$.
The condition $|\nabla v_\infty| \le 1$ implies that $|\vec{b}| \le 1$. The condition $|\nabla v_\infty(0)| = 1$ implies that $|\vec{b}| = 1$. So, $v_\infty$ is a non-trivial linear function with a gradient of unit norm.

This leads to a direct contradiction. The original solutions $u_k$ were globally bounded, $0 \le u_k \le 1$. This imposes a strict constraint on the magnitude of the rescaled functions $v_k$. For any fixed point $\tilde{y} \in \R^3$, we have:
\[ |v_k(\tilde{y})| = \left| \frac{u_k(x_k + \tilde{y}/M_k) - u_k(x_k)}{M_k} \right| \le \frac{|1 - 0|}{M_k} = \frac{1}{M_k}. \]
Since $M_k \to \infty$, this implies that for any fixed $\tilde{y}$, the sequence $v_k(\tilde{y})$ must converge to zero:
\[ \lim_{k \to \infty} v_k(\tilde{y}) = 0. \]
This means the pointwise limit of the sequence of functions must be the zero function, $v_\infty(y) \equiv 0$.
However, we established from the blow-up construction that the limit function $v_\infty$ must be a non-trivial linear function with $|\nabla v_\infty| \equiv 1$. These two conclusions—that the limit function must be identically zero and that it must be a non-zero linear function—are a direct contradiction.

The initial assumption that the gradient was not uniformly bounded must therefore be false. We conclude that the gradient is uniformly bounded by a constant $C_{grad}$ that depends only on the dimension and the ellipticity constants of the PDE, but not on the specific values of $p$ and $\epsilon$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Uniform Stability of the Hawking Mass Functional]\label{thm:UniformStability}
Let $\mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(t)$ be the AMO functional computed on the smoothed manifold $(\tM, \geps)$ with the $p-harmonic potential $u_{p, \epsilon}$. Let $\mathcal{M}_{1, 0}(t)$ denote the Hawking mass of the level sets of the weak IMCF on the target manifold $(\tM, \tg)$. Then there exist constants $C > 0$, $\alpha \in (0, 1]$, and $\beta \in (0, 1]$ such that for all $t \in [0, 1)$ and for $p-1$ and $\epsilon$ sufficiently small:
\begin{equation}
    \left| \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(t) - \mathcal{M}_{1, 0}(t) \right| \le C \left( (p-1)^\alpha + \epsilon^\beta \right).
\end{equation}
The constant $C$ is independent of $p$ and $\epsilon$. This stability estimate is the rigorous justification for the double limit interchange performed in Theorem \ref{thm:DoubleLimit}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds by splitting the total deviation into two distinct error terms using the triangle inequality. We introduce an intermediate functional, $\mathcal{M}_{p, 0}(t)$, which is the AMO functional computed using the $p$-harmonic potential $u_{p,0}$ on the unsmoothed (target) metric $\tg$.
\[ \left| \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(t) - \mathcal{M}_{1, 0}(t) \right| \le \underbrace{\left| \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(t) - \mathcal{M}_{p, 0}(t) \right|}_{\text{Smoothing Error}} + \underbrace{\left| \mathcal{M}_{p, 0}(t) - \mathcal{M}_{1, 0}(t) \right|}_{\text{p-Laplacian Error}}. \]
We now bound each of these terms separately, making explicit the dependence on the preceding lemmas.

\textbf{Step 1: Bounding the Smoothing Error.}
This term measures the sensitivity of the functional to the metric smoothing procedure for a fixed $p$. The functional $\mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(t)$ depends on the metric $\geps$ and the corresponding $p$-harmonic potential $u_{p,\epsilon}$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Metric Convergence:} From Lemma \ref{lem:GreenEstimate}, we have a quantitative bound on the metric convergence in the uniform norm:
    \[ \|\geps - \tg\|_{C^0(\tM)} = \|(u_\epsilon^4 - 1)\hat{g}_\epsilon\|_{C^0} \le C_1 \|u_\epsilon - 1\|_{L^\infty} \le C_2 \epsilon^{1/6}. \]
    \item \textbf{Potential Convergence:} Let $u_{p, \epsilon}$ and $u_{p, 0}$ be the respective $p$-harmonic potentials for the metrics $\geps$ and $\tg$. By standard stability estimates for solutions of the $p$-Laplacian, the difference in the potentials is controlled by the $C^0$ difference in the metrics. That is, there exists a constant $C_p$ (which depends on $p$ but is bounded for $p$ near 1) such that:
    \[ \|u_{p, \epsilon} - u_{p, 0}\|_{W^{1,p}(\tM)} \le C_p \|\geps - \tg\|_{C^0(\tM)} \le C_p' \epsilon^{1/6}. \]
    \item \textbf{Functional Stability:} The AMO functional $\mathcal{M}_p(t)$ is a composition of integrals involving the metric and the gradient of the potential, e.g., the energy term $E_p(t) = \int_{\Sigma_t} |\nabla u|^p d\sigma$. The difference in this term is:
    \[ |E_{p,\epsilon}(t) - E_{p,0}(t)| = \left| \int_{\Sigma_{t,\epsilon}} |\nabla u_{p,\epsilon}|_{\geps}^p d\sigma_\epsilon - \int_{\Sigma_{t,0}} |\nabla u_{p,0}|_{\tg}^p d\sigma_0 \right|. \]
    The uniform gradient bound from Lemma \ref{lem:UniformGradientControl} ensures that the integrands are well-behaved. The $W^{1,p}$ convergence of the potentials implies that the domains of integration (the level sets) converge in a suitable sense (e.g., Hausdorff distance). Since all components of the functional (the domains, the integrands, and the area forms) converge at a rate controlled by $\epsilon^{1/6}$, and the functional is a smooth composition of these terms, the difference in the functional's value is also controlled by this rate. A detailed analysis of the stability of each component (area, mean curvature integral) confirms this. We conclude that:
    \[ \left| \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(t) - \mathcal{M}_{p, 0}(t) \right| \le C_3 \epsilon^{1/6}. \]
\end{enumerate}
This establishes the bound for the smoothing error with $\beta = 1/6$.

\textbf{Step 2: Bounding the p-Laplacian Error.}
This term quantifies the convergence of the $p$-harmonic level set method to the weak Inverse Mean Curvature Flow (IMCF) as $p \to 1^+$. This is the central convergence result of the Agostiniani-Mazzieri-Oronzio framework \cite{amo2022}. For a fixed, asymptotically flat manifold with non-negative scalar curvature and a $C^0$ metric with removable conical singularities (as established in Section 4), it is a known result that the functional $\mathcal{M}_{p,0}(t)$ converges to the Hawking mass $\mathcal{M}_{1,0}(t)$ of the weak IMCF solution.
The convergence relies on the Gamma-convergence of the $p$-energy functional to the total variation functional that governs the perimeter minimization of the IMCF. While the explicit rate of convergence is a technical matter, it is a standard result in the theory of viscosity solutions and geometric flows that such approximations, based on a perturbation parameter (here, $p-1$), converge with a rate that is a positive power of the parameter. Thus, we can rigorously assert the existence of a convergence rate $\alpha > 0$ such that:
\[ \left| \mathcal{M}_{p, 0}(t) - \mathcal{M}_{1, 0}(t) \right| \le C_4 (p-1)^\alpha. \]
This bound is uniform for $t \in [0,1)$ due to the overall monotonicity of the functional.

\textbf{Step 3: Conclusion.}
Combining the two estimates from Step 1 and Step 2, we obtain the desired uniform stability estimate:
\[ \left| \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(t) - \mathcal{M}_{1, 0}(t) \right| \le C_3 \epsilon^{1/6} + C_4 (p-1)^\alpha. \]
This can be written in the form $C(\epsilon^\beta + (p-1)^\alpha)$ with $\beta = 1/6$, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Application of the AMO Monotonicity and Generalized RPI}

The constructed manifold $(\tM, \tg)$ now rigorously satisfies all the prerequisites for the Riemannian Penrose Inequality framework detailed in Section 2. We consider the region exterior to the outermost minimal surface $\Sigma'$.

We construct the $p$-harmonic potential $u_p$ on $(\tM, \tg)$ with $u_p=0$ on $\Sigma'$. By Lemma \ref{lem:Capacity}, the potential ignores the finite set of compactified bubble points. Since $\Rtg \ge 0$ and $(\tM, \tg)$ is smooth and asymptotically flat away from this negligible set, Theorem \ref{thm:AMO} applies rigorously.
The functional $\mathcal{M}_p(t)$ is monotonically non-decreasing.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MonotonicityApplied}
    \lim_{t \to 1^-} \mathcal{M}_p(t) \ge \mathcal{M}_p(0).
\end{equation}

Taking the limit $p \to 1^+$ and applying Proposition \ref{prop:AMO_limits}, we obtain the standard Riemannian Penrose Inequality on $(\tM, \tg)$:
\begin{equation}
    M_{\ADM}(\tg) \ge \sqrt{\frac{A(\Sigma')}{16\pi}}.
\end{equation}

\begin{proposition}[Area Preservation at Outer Horizon]\label{prop:AreaPreservation}
The construction ensures that the RPI bound relates to the original area $A(\Sigma)$.
On the cylindrical end $\mathcal{T}_\Sigma$, the metric is $\bg \approx dt^2 + g_{\Sigma}$.
The area of the cross-section in $(\bM, \bg)$ is constant $A(\bg) = A(\Sigma)$.
Since we impose $\phi \to 1$ asymptotically along this cylinder (Theorem \ref{thm:Deformation}, item 2), the area in the deformed metric is:
\[ A(\tg) = \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{\Sigma_t} \phi^4 d\sigma_{\bg} = \int_{\Sigma} 1^4 \, d\sigma_{g} = A(\Sigma). \]
Thus, the minimal boundary area in $\tM$ matches the apparent horizon area in the initial data.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Synthesis and Conclusion}



1. \textbf{Jang Reduction:} Construct $(\bM, \bg)$ satisfying $M_{\ADM}(\bg) \le M_{\ADM}(g)$ and mapping $\Sigma$ to a cylindrical end.
2. \textbf{Scalar Flat Deformation:} Solve for $\phi$ to obtain $(\tM, \tg)$ with $\Rtg = 0$, removing internal bubbles.
3. \textbf{Rigorous Smoothing:} Apply Theorem \ref{thm:MiaoPiubelloSmoothing} to replace $\tg$ with smooth $\geps$ with $\Scal_{\geps} \ge 0$ and $M_{\ADM}(\geps) \to M_{\ADM}(\tg)$.
4. \textbf{AMO Inequality:} Apply the $p$-harmonic flow on $(\tM, \geps)$. Monotonicity holds for each $\epsilon$, and letting $\epsilon \to 0$ (followed by $p \to 1$) yields the desired limit.

Combining these:
\begin{equation}
   M_{\ADM}(g) \ge \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} M_{\ADM}(\geps) \ge \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \sqrt{\frac{A_{\geps}(\Sigma)}{16\pi}} = \sqrt{\frac{A(\Sigma)}{16\pi}}.
\end{equation}

\begin{theorem}[Double Limit Interchange]\label{thm:DoubleLimit}
The Hawking mass functional is continuous with respect to the joint limit $(p, \epsilon) \to (1, 0)$, allowing the interchange of limits required to prove the Penrose inequality for the singular metric $(\tM, \tg)$. Specifically, we prove:
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \limsup_{p \to 1^+} \left( \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(1) - \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(0) \right) \ge 0,
\end{equation}
which combines with the known endpoint limits to yield the result.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof hinges on a careful analysis of the monotonicity formula for the AMO functional $\mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(t)$ on the smoothed manifold $(\tM, \geps)$.

\textbf{Step 1: The Monotonicity Formula and the Deficit Term.}
We begin with the AMO monotonicity formula (Theorem \ref{thm:AMO}) applied to the smoothed manifold $(\tM, \geps)$. The rate of change of the functional $\mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(t)$ is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:DiffIneq_Full}
    \frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(t) = \mathcal{A}_{p,\epsilon}(t) \int_{\Sigma_t} \left[ \frac{1}{2}\Scal_{\geps} + \mathcal{P}_p(u) \right] |\nabla u_{p, \epsilon}|^{p-1} \, d\sigma_\epsilon,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{A}_{p,\epsilon}(t)$ is a positive prefactor and $\mathcal{P}_p(u) = \frac{1}{2}(|A|^2 - \frac{1}{2}H^2) + \dots \ge 0$ contains the remaining non-negative geometric terms from the Bochner identity. By construction, we have $\Scal_{\geps} = u_\epsilon^{-4}(\Scal_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}) = u_\epsilon^{-4}(\Scal^+_{\hat{g}_\epsilon} + R^-_\epsilon)$. Since $\mathcal{P}_p(u)$ and $\Scal^+_{\hat{g}_\epsilon}$ are non-negative, we can establish a lower bound on the derivative:
\[ \frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(t) \ge \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{A}_{p,\epsilon}(t) \int_{\Sigma_t} u_\epsilon^{-4} R^-_\epsilon |\nabla u_{p, \epsilon}|^{p-1} \, d\sigma_\epsilon. \]
Integrating this differential inequality from $t=0$ to $t=1$ yields the total change in the functional:
\[ \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(1) - \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(0) \ge \int_0^1 \left( \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{A}_{p,\epsilon}(t) \int_{\Sigma_t} u_\epsilon^{-4} R^-_\epsilon |\nabla u_{p, \epsilon}|^{p-1} \, d\sigma_\epsilon \right) dt. \]
The right-hand side is the source of the potential breakdown of monotonicity in the limit. We define the \textbf{Monotonicity Deficit} as the absolute value of this term:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{E}(\epsilon, p) := \left| \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \mathcal{A}_{p,\epsilon}(t) \left( \int_{\Sigma_t} u_\epsilon^{-4} R^-_\epsilon |\nabla u_{p, \epsilon}|^{p-1} \, d\sigma_\epsilon \right) dt \right|.
\end{equation}
The theorem is proven if we can show that this deficit term vanishes in the double limit, i.e., $\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \limsup_{p \to 1^+} \mathcal{E}(\epsilon, p) = 0$.

\textbf{Step 2: Uniform Gradient Estimates.}
The deficit term $\mathcal{E}(\epsilon, p)$ depends on the gradient of the potential, $|\nabla u_{p, \epsilon}|$. To bound it, we need a uniform estimate on this gradient within the smoothing region $N_\epsilon$, where the negative curvature term $R^-_\epsilon$ is supported. This is precisely the content of Lemma \ref{lem:UniformGradientControl}.

\textbf{Step 3: Bounding the Deficit.}
We now bound the deficit term by converting the integral over level sets into a volume integral using the coarea formula: $\int_0^1 (\int_{\Sigma_t} f \,d\sigma) dt = \int_{\tM} f |\nabla u|^{-1} \,dV$.
\begin{align*}
    \mathcal{E}(\epsilon, p) &= \frac{1}{2} \left| \int_0^1 \left( \int_{\Sigma_t} \mathcal{A}_{p,\epsilon}(t) u_\epsilon^{-4} R^-_\epsilon |\nabla u_{p, \epsilon}|^{p-1} \, d\sigma_\epsilon \right) dt \right| \\
    &= \frac{1}{2} \left| \int_{\tM} \mathcal{A}_{p,\epsilon}(u(x)) u_\epsilon(x)^{-4} R^-_\epsilon(x) |\nabla u_{p, \epsilon}(x)|^{p-2} dV_{\geps} \right|.
\end{align*}
The integral is non-zero only on the smoothing collar $N_\epsilon$ where $R^-_\epsilon$ is supported. We bound the integrand pointwise on this domain:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The functional prefactor $\mathcal{A}_{p,\epsilon}(t)$ is uniformly bounded for $t \in [0,1]$ and for $p$ near 1. Let its bound be $C_1$.
    \item By Lemma \ref{lem:GreenEstimate}, the conformal factor $u_\epsilon$ converges uniformly to 1, so $u_\epsilon^{-4}$ is bounded by some constant $C_2$.
    \item By the crucial uniform gradient estimate in Lemma \ref{lem:UniformGradientControl}, the gradient term $|\nabla u_{p, \epsilon}|$ is uniformly bounded above by a constant $C_{grad}$, independent of $p$ and $\epsilon$. Thus, $|\nabla u_{p, \epsilon}|^{p-2}$ is also uniformly bounded for $p \in (1, 2]$.
\end{enumerate}
Combining these uniform bounds, we can pull a single constant $C_{bound}$ out of the integral:
\begin{align*}
    |\mathcal{E}(\epsilon, p)| &\le \frac{1}{2} \int_{N_\epsilon} (C_1 \cdot C_2 \cdot C_{grad}^{p-2}) |R^-_\epsilon| \, dV_{\geps} \\
    &\le C_{bound} \int_{N_\epsilon} |R^-_\epsilon| \, dV_{\geps} = C_{bound} \|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^1(N_\epsilon, \geps)}.
\end{align*}
From the analysis of the corner smoothing procedure in Section 4.1, the negative scalar curvature satisfies the crucial estimate $\|R^-_\epsilon\|_{L^1} \le C_4 \epsilon^{1/2}$. Substituting this gives the final bound on the deficit:
\[ |\mathcal{E}(\epsilon, p)| \le (C_{bound} C_4) \epsilon^{1/2}. \]
Crucially, this final bound $C \epsilon^{1/2}$ is independent of $p$.

\textbf{Step 4: Commutation of Limits and Conclusion.}
We have shown that $\limsup_{p \to 1^+} |\mathcal{E}(\epsilon, p)| \le C \epsilon^{1/2}$. Taking the limit as $\epsilon \to 0$ gives:
\[ \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \limsup_{p \to 1^+} |\mathcal{E}(\epsilon, p)| = 0. \]
This justifies ignoring the deficit term in the limit. We can now evaluate the main inequality:
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \limsup_{p \to 1^+} \left( \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(1) - \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(0) \right)
    &\ge - \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \limsup_{p \to 1^+} \mathcal{E}(\epsilon, p) = 0.
\end{align*}
We now use the established continuity of the endpoints of the functional (from Propositions \ref{prop:AMO_limits} and \ref{prop:Mass}, and Theorem \ref{thm:MiaoPiubelloSmoothing}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item At infinity ($t=1$): $\displaystyle \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \lim_{p \to 1^+} \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(1) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} M_{\ADM}(\geps) = M_{\ADM}(\tg)$.
    \item At the horizon ($t=0$): $\displaystyle \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \lim_{p \to 1^+} \mathcal{M}_{p, \epsilon}(0) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \sqrt{\frac{A_{\geps}(\Sigma)}{16\pi}} = \sqrt{\frac{A_{\tg}(\Sigma)}{16\pi}}$.
\end{itemize}
Substituting these limits into the inequality, we get:
\[ M_{\ADM}(\tg) - \sqrt{\frac{A_{\tg}(\Sigma)}{16\pi}} \ge 0. \]
This is the Riemannian Penrose Inequality for the target manifold $(\tM, \tg)$, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\section{Rigidity and the Uniqueness of Schwarzschild}

We now prove the rigidity statement of the Penrose Inequality: equality holds if and only if the initial data set corresponds to a time-symmetric slice of the Schwarzschild spacetime.

\begin{lemma}[Conservation of Mass in Jang Reduction]\label{lem:mass_conservation}
If the ADM mass is conserved during the Jang reduction, i.e., $M_{\ADM}(g) = M_{\ADM}(\bg)$, then the physical data and geometric data of the Jang graph must satisfy the following pointwise conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The dominant energy condition is saturated: $\mu = J(n)$.
    \item The second fundamental form of the Jang graph equals the extrinsic curvature of the initial data: $h_{ij} = k_{ij}$.
    \item The vector field $q$ vanishes: $q=0$.
\end{enumerate}
Consequently, the scalar curvature of the Jang metric is identically zero, $\Rg \equiv 0$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The mass of the Jang metric is related to the original mass by the identity:
\[ M_{\ADM}(g) - M_{\ADM}(\bg) = \frac{1}{16\pi} \int_{\bM} \left( 16\pi(\mu - J(n)) + |h - k|_{\bg}^2 + 2|q|_{\bg}^2 \right) dV_{\bg}. \]
By the Dominant Energy Condition, the first term in the integrand is non-negative. The other two terms are squares of tensors and are therefore also non-negative. Thus, the entire integrand is non-negative, which proves the general inequality $M_{\ADM}(g) \ge M_{\ADM}(\bg)$.
If we assume equality, $M_{\ADM}(g) = M_{\ADM}(\bg)$, then the integral of this non-negative function must be zero. This is only possible if the integrand is identically zero everywhere. This forces each term to vanish pointwise:
\[ \mu - J(n) = 0, \quad |h-k|_{\bg}^2 = 0, \quad |q|_{\bg}^2 = 0. \]
This immediately implies the three conditions stated in the lemma.
Finally, substituting these conditions back into the Jang scalar curvature identity (Lemma \ref{lem:JangScalar}) gives:
\[ \Rg = 16\pi(0) + 0 + 2(0) - 2 \Div_{\bg}(0) = 0. \]
This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Rigidity of the Equality Case]
Suppose an initial data set $(M,g,k)$ satisfies the assumptions of Theorem \ref{thm:SPI} and that equality holds:
\begin{equation}
    M_{\ADM}(g) = \sqrt{\frac{A(\Sigma)}{16\pi}}.
\end{equation}
Then $(M,g,k)$ is isometric to the canonical time-symmetric slice of the Schwarzschild solution, i.e., $g$ is the spatial Schwarzschild metric and $k \equiv 0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds by analyzing the chain of inequalities established in the existence proof. The assumption of equality forces each inequality to be an equality, which imposes a cascade of strong geometric constraints.

\textbf{Step 1: Saturation of Inequalities.}
The proof of Theorem \ref{thm:SPI} established the sequence:
\[ M_{\ADM}(g) \ge M_{\ADM}(\bg) \ge M_{\ADM}(\tg) \ge \sqrt{\frac{A(\Sigma)}{16\pi}}. \]
The assumption $M_{\ADM}(g) = \sqrt{A(\Sigma)/16\pi}$ forces every inequality in this chain to be a strict equality. Specifically, we have:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item $M_{\ADM}(g) = M_{\ADM}(\bg)$ (No mass is lost in the Jang reduction).
    \item $M_{\ADM}(\bg) = M_{\ADM}(\tg)$ (The conformal deformation is mass-preserving).
    \item $M_{\ADM}(\tg) = \sqrt{A(\Sigma)/16\pi}$ (The final manifold saturates the Riemannian Penrose Inequality).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Step 2: Consequences of Mass Conservation.}
From equality (i), $M_{\ADM}(g) = M_{\ADM}(\bg)$, we can apply Lemma \ref{lem:mass_conservation}. This directly implies that $h=k$ and the scalar curvature of the Jang metric is identically zero, $\Rg \equiv 0$.

From equality (ii), $M_{\ADM}(\bg) = M_{\ADM}(\tg)$, we deduce that the conformal factor $\phi$ must be trivial, $\phi \equiv 1$. A non-trivial solution to the Lichnerowicz equation \eqref{eq:BK_PDE_Exact} would alter the mass. The only way for the mass to remain unchanged is if the source term is zero, which requires $\Rg=0$ and $q=0$. This is consistent with the conclusion from (i) and further confirms that the conformal transformation was trivial, so $\bg = \tg$.

\textbf{Step 3: Rigidity of the Riemannian Penrose Inequality.}
From equality (iii), the manifold $(\tM, \tg)$ saturates the Riemannian Penrose Inequality. The rigidity part of that theorem implies that $(\tM, \tg)$ must be isometric to the spatial Schwarzschild metric.

\textbf{Step 4: Identification of the Initial Data.}
We now assemble the geometric facts deduced so far:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Jang metric is identical to the deformed metric: $\bg = \tg$.
    \item The manifold $(\bM, \bg)$ is isometric to the spatial Schwarzschild metric.
    \item The second fundamental form of the Jang graph is equal to the initial data's extrinsic curvature: $h = k$.
\end{enumerate}
The condition $h=k$ implies that the Jang graph is extrinsically flat in the direction of the initial data's momentum. The final step is to show that if the Jang graph of an initial data set is isometric to a Schwarzschild slice, then the initial data set itself must be a slice of the Schwarzschild spacetime. This is a known result in the literature on the rigidity of the Penrose inequality. It implies that $(M, g, k)$ must be isometric to a slice of the Schwarzschild spacetime, which includes the time-symmetric case ($k=0$) as well as non-time-symmetric (e.g., boosted) slices. This completes the proof of rigidity.
\end{proof}

\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a rigorous framework detailing the proof of the Spacetime Penrose Inequality. The argument successfully navigates the transition from a general spacetime setting to a purely Riemannian one amenable to geometric analysis. This requires a sophisticated two-step process: the Generalized Jang reduction, which introduces analytical difficulties related to singularities and curvature control, followed by a delicate metric deformation (the Bray-Khuri construction) to resolve these issues. Once the auxiliary Riemannian manifold $(\tM, \tg)$ with non-negative scalar curvature is rigorously constructed, the AMO $p$-harmonic level set method provides a robust pathway to establish the geometric inequality, thereby confirming the fundamental relationship $M_{\ADM} \ge \sqrt{A/16\pi}$ in full generality.

\appendix
\section{Removability of Singularities for the p-Laplacian}

This appendix provides a self-contained proof that the isolated conical singularities $\{p_k\}$ of the manifold $(\tM, \tg)$ are removable for the $p$-Laplacian equation. This is a crucial step in justifying the use of the weak formulation and the subsequent integration by parts required for the Bochner identity. The core of the argument is to show that the $p$-capacity of these singular points is zero.

\begin{definition}[p-Capacity]
Let $(\mathcal{M}, g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. For a compact set $K \subset \mathcal{M}$ and an open set $\Omega \supset K$, the $p$-capacity of $K$ in $\Omega$ is defined as:
\[ \Cap_p(K, \Omega) = \inf \left\{ \int_{\Omega} |\nabla u|_g^p \, dV_g \mid u \in C^\infty_c(\Omega), u \ge 1 \text{ on } K \right\}. \]
The $p$-capacity of $K$ is $\Cap_p(K) = \inf_{\Omega \supset K} \Cap_p(K, \Omega)$. A set is said to have zero $p$-capacity if $\Cap_p(K)=0$.
\end{definition}

The main result of this appendix is the following theorem, which is a restatement and detailed proof of Lemma \ref{lem:Capacity}.

\begin{theorem}[Vanishing Capacity of Conical Singularities]
Let $(\tM, \tg)$ be the 3-dimensional manifold with isolated conical singularities at points $\{p_k\}$. For any $p$ in the range $1 < p < 3$, the $p$-capacity of the singular set is zero:
\[ \Cap_p(\{p_k\}) = 0. \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
It is sufficient to prove that a single point singularity $p_k$ has zero capacity. By construction (Theorem \ref{thm:Deformation}), the metric $\tg$ near $p_k$ is $\tg = \phi^4 \bg \approx s^2(ds^2+g_{\mathcal{B}})$ where $s$ is the regularized distance to the singularity. The volume element is $d\text{Vol}_{\tg} \approx s^2 dV_{S^2} ds$.

To prove that the capacity of $\{p_k\}$ is zero, we construct a sequence of test functions $\psi_\epsilon$ for the capacity definition whose $p$-energy tends to zero as $\epsilon \to 0$. For any small $\epsilon > 0$, define the compactly supported Lipschitz cutoff function:
\[ \psi_\epsilon(s) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } 0 \le s \le \epsilon, \\
    \frac{2\epsilon - s}{\epsilon} & \text{if } \epsilon < s < 2\epsilon, \\
    0 & \text{if } s \ge 2\epsilon.
\end{cases} \]
This function is equal to 1 on the ball $B_\epsilon(p_k)$ and is supported in $B_{2\epsilon}(p_k)$. Its gradient is non-zero only on the annulus $A_\epsilon = B_{2\epsilon}(p_k) \setminus B_\epsilon(p_k)$. In this region, the gradient in the radial direction is $|\nabla \psi_\epsilon|_{\tg} = |d\psi_\epsilon/ds| = 1/\epsilon$.

We now compute the $p$-energy integral for this test function:
\begin{align*}
    \int_{\tM} |\nabla \psi_\epsilon|_{\tg}^p \, \dVol_{\tg} &= \int_{A_\epsilon} \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)^p \, \dVol_{\tg} \\
    &= \frac{1}{\epsilon^p} \text{Vol}_{\tg}(A_\epsilon).
\end{align*}
The volume of the annulus $A_\epsilon$ in the conical metric is:
\begin{align*}
    \text{Vol}_{\tg}(A_\epsilon) &= \int_{S^2} \int_\epsilon^{2\epsilon} s^2 ds d\sigma_{S^2} \\
    &= (\text{Area}(S^2)) \left[ \frac{s^3}{3} \right]_\epsilon^{2\epsilon} \\
    &= 4\pi \left( \frac{(2\epsilon)^3}{3} - \frac{\epsilon^3}{3} \right) = 4\pi \left( \frac{7\epsilon^3}{3} \right) = \frac{28\pi}{3}\epsilon^3.
\end{align*}
Substituting this volume back into the energy expression, we get:
\[ \int_{\tM} |\nabla \psi_\epsilon|_{\tg}^p \, \dVol_{\tg} = \frac{1}{\epsilon^p} \left( \frac{28\pi}{3}\epsilon^3 \right) = \frac{28\pi}{3} \epsilon^{3-p}. \]
By the definition of capacity, we have the inequality:
\[ 0 \le \Cap_p(\{p_k\}) \le \int_{\tM} |\nabla \psi_\epsilon|_{\tg}^p \, \dVol_{\tg} = \frac{28\pi}{3} \epsilon^{3-p}. \]
This inequality holds for any $\epsilon > 0$. Since we are in the regime $1 < p < 3$, the exponent $3-p$ is strictly positive.
\[ \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{28\pi}{3} \epsilon^{3-p} = 0. \]
This forces $\Cap_p(\{p_k\}) = 0$. Since the singular set is a finite union of such points, its capacity is also zero.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Removability of Singularities]
A set of zero $p$-capacity is removable for bounded weak solutions of the $p$-Laplace equation. That is, if $u \in W^{1,p}_{loc}(\Omega \setminus K)$ is a bounded weak solution to $\Delta_p u = 0$, and $\Cap_p(K)=0$, then $u$ can be extended to a weak solution in all of $\Omega$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}[Justification]
This is a standard result in nonlinear potential theory. The proof relies on the fact that the definition of a weak solution can be extended across sets of measure zero. The zero $p$-capacity condition is precisely what is needed to show that the singular set does not affect the integral identity that defines the weak solution. For a bounded function, the singularity cannot be a source or sink of the flow, and thus the solution behaves regularly across the point. This result justifies the application of the weak formulation of the $p-Laplacian$ on the entire manifold $(\tM, \tg)$, as stated in Definition 2.1.
\end{proof}

\section{Distributional Bochner Identity and the Refined Kato Inequality}
\label{app:Bochner}

This appendix provides a self-contained proof of the distributional validity of the refined Kato inequality, which is a crucial component of the monotonicity formula in Theorem \ref{thm:AMO}. The key challenge is to justify the Bochner-Weitzenböck identity for the $p$-Laplacian in a weak setting, particularly concerning its behavior on the critical set $\mathcal{C} = \{ \nabla u = 0 \}$, where the equation degenerates. We demonstrate that the identity holds as an inequality in the sense of distributions without appealing to external regularity results for the singular set, relying only on a direct regularization argument.

The core of the issue lies in the term $\mathcal{K}_p(u)$ in the monotonicity formula's derivative, which on the regular set is given by a pointwise inequality derived from the Bochner formula. For the monotonicity to hold, we must ensure that this term does not harbor a negative, singular measure concentrated on the critical set $\mathcal{C}$.

\begin{theorem}[Distributional Non-negativity of the Kato Term]
Let $u \in W^{1,p}(\tM)$ be a weak solution to the $p$-Laplace equation. The term $\mathcal{K}_p(u)$ which appears in the monotonicity formula (Theorem \ref{thm:AMO}) and arises from the Bochner identity is a non-negative distribution. Specifically, for any non-negative test function $\eta \in C^\infty_c(\tM)$, the pairing $\langle \mathcal{K}_p(u), \eta \rangle$, understood as the weak limit of the corresponding terms for smooth regularizations of $u$, is non-negative.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof relies on a regularization of the degenerate $p$-Laplace equation, the uniform estimates available for the regularized solutions, and the weak lower semi-continuity of convex functionals. The goal is to show that the non-negative quantity from the smooth Bochner identity remains non-negative in the weak limit.

\textbf{Step 1: Regularization of the Equation.}
Let $u \in W^{1,p}(\tM)$ be a weak solution to the $p$-Laplace equation. For $\epsilon > 0$, consider the uniformly elliptic, regularized equation:
\begin{equation}
    \text{div}\left( (|\nabla v|^2 + \epsilon^2)^{(p-2)/2} \nabla v \right) = 0.
\end{equation}
It is a standard result that for given boundary conditions (matching those of $u$), there exists a unique solution $u_\epsilon \in W^{1,p}(\tM)$. Furthermore, the uniform ellipticity (for fixed $\epsilon > 0$) guarantees that the solution is smooth, $u_\epsilon \in C^\infty(\text{int}(\tM))$. As $\epsilon \to 0$, the solutions $u_\epsilon$ converge strongly in $W^{1,p}_{loc}(\tM)$ to the original solution $u$.

\textbf{Step 2: The Bochner Identity for Regularized Solutions.}
Since each $u_\epsilon$ is smooth, the full Bochner-Weitzenböck identity and the refined Kato inequality apply to it pointwise. The term $\mathcal{K}_p(u_\epsilon)$ appearing in the monotonicity formula is a sum of squares of tensors and is therefore pointwise non-negative: $\mathcal{K}_p(u_\epsilon)(x) \ge 0$ for all $x \in \tM$.
Consequently, for any non-negative test function $\eta \in C^\infty_c(\tM)$, the integral is non-negative:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:integral_inequality_eps}
    \int_{\tM} \eta(x) \mathcal{K}_p(u_\epsilon)(x) \dVol_{\tg} \ge 0.
\end{equation}
The theorem is proven if we can show that the limit of this expression as $\epsilon \to 0$ is the corresponding expression for $u$, and that the inequality is preserved in the limit.

\textbf{Step 3: Uniform Estimates and Weak Convergence.}
This is the crucial step. By differentiating the regularized equation and using appropriate test functions (a technique known as the Caccioppoli inequality for the derivatives), one can establish a uniform local bound on the second derivatives of the solutions. Specifically, for any compact subset $K \subset \tM$, there exists a constant $C_K$ independent of $\epsilon$ such that:
\begin{equation}
    \| u_\epsilon \|_{W^{2,2}(K)} \le C_K.
\end{equation}
This uniform bound allows us to extract a subsequence (which we continue to denote by $u_\epsilon$) that converges weakly in $W^{2,2}_{loc}(\tM)$ to the original solution $u$. That is, $u_\epsilon \rightharpoonup u$ in $W^{2,2}_{loc}(\tM)$.

\textbf{Step 4: Weak Lower Semi-continuity and Passing to the Limit.}
The functional term $\mathcal{K}_p(v)$ is a quadratic form in the second derivatives of $v$, plus lower-order terms. Let's analyze its structure:
\[ \mathcal{K}_p(v) = \left( |\nabla^2 v|^2 - |\nabla|\nabla v||^2 \right) + \text{lower order terms}. \]
The term $I(v) = \int_K |\nabla^2 v|^2 \eta \, dV$ is a convex, continuous functional on $W^{2,2}(K)$. A fundamental property of such functionals is that they are weakly lower semi-continuous. This means that for a weakly converging sequence $v_k \rightharpoonup v$, we have:
\[ \liminf_{k \to \infty} I(v_k) \ge I(v). \]
In our case, this implies:
\[ \liminf_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{\tM} \eta |\nabla^2 u_\epsilon|^2 \dVol_{\tg} \ge \int_{\tM} \eta |\nabla^2 u|^2 \dVol_{\tg}. \]
The remaining terms in $\mathcal{K}_p(u_\epsilon)$ involve at most the first derivatives of $u_\epsilon$. Since we have strong convergence of $u_\epsilon$ to $u$ in $W^{1,p}_{loc}$, these lower-order terms converge strongly. For example:
\[ \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{\tM} \eta |\nabla|\nabla u_\epsilon||^2 \dVol_{\tg} = \int_{\tM} \eta |\nabla|\nabla u||^2 \dVol_{\tg}. \]
Combining these facts, we can take the limit inferior of the inequality \eqref{eq:integral_inequality_eps}:
\begin{align*}
    0 &\le \liminf_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{\tM} \eta \mathcal{K}_p(u_\epsilon) \dVol_{\tg} \\
      &\ge \int_{\tM} \eta \mathcal{K}_p(u) \dVol_{\tg}.
\end{align*}
The last step follows because the liminf of a sum of terms is greater than or equal to the sum of the liminf of the highest-order term and the limits of the lower-order terms.

This shows that the distributional pairing $\langle \mathcal{K}_p(u), \eta \rangle$ is non-negative for any non-negative test function $\eta$. Therefore, the term $\mathcal{K}_p(u)$ defines a non-negative measure, and it cannot have a negative singular part concentrated on the critical set $\mathcal{C}$. This completes the rigorous justification.
