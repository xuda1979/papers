# The Quantum PCP (Probabilistically Checkable Proof) Conjecture

## Domain
Quantum Complexity Theory

## The Problem
This is likely the "grand challenge" of quantum complexity. In classical complexity, the PCP theorem states that for any problem in NP, there exists a proof that can be verified by reading only a constant number of bits. The **Quantum PCP conjecture** asks if there is a quantum analogue: *Is calculating the ground state energy of a local Hamiltonian (a physical energy function) hard to approximate even with a constant error margin?*

## Implications
If true, it would mean that "entanglement" makes finding even *approximate* solutions to quantum physical systems extremely difficult (QMA-hard). It is deeply connected to the stability of entanglement at room temperature.

## Status
**Open.** A related precursor, the **NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial States) Conjecture**, was **solved** recently (2023) by Anshu, Breuckmann, and Nirkhe, proving that there *are* systems where all low-energy states remain highly entangled. However, the full Quantum PCP conjecture remains unsolved.
