\begin{abstract}
Large–context sequence models such as Transformers and state–space models have
dramatically advanced natural language processing, but at the cost of quadratic
or linear scaling and potential stability issues. In this work we propose
\emph{Discrete Token–Flow Networks} (DTFNs), a new class of neural sequence
models inspired by finite–volume numerical schemes for hyperbolic partial
differential equations. In lieu of attention or convolutional kernels, DTFNs
propagate information by computing conservative, non‑negative fluxes between
neighboring tokens. This design enforces mass conservation and positivity by
construction, and a learnable Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) factor ensures
stable propagation. We demonstrate these properties through numerical
experiments, compare with related architectures, and provide reference
PyTorch code for training on synthetic Dyck--1 bracket sequences.

\section{Introduction}
Transformer–based models underpin most state–of–the–art language models, yet
their $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ attention mechanism limits efficiency for long contexts.
Recent alternatives such as structured state–space models (SSMs) reduce
complexity\,\cite{gu2021combining,gu2022efficiently}, but still rely on implicit
convolutions or linear recurrences. Meanwhile, finite–volume methods from
computational fluid dynamics offer a principled way to evolve distributions
while preserving conservation laws\,\cite{leveque2002finite}. We ask: \emph{Can
these principles yield stable and efficient sequence models for language?}

The challenges facing long–context modeling are twofold: computational
\emph{complexity} and numerical \emph{stability}. Transformers require
quadratic time and memory in the sequence length $L$ due to global attention.
SSMs reduce this to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ but still involve linear recurrences that
may suffer from vanishing gradients. In contrast, finite–volume solvers
operate with strictly local interactions, updating each position using only
its nearest neighbors. Consequently, a single update of a DTFN scales as
$\mathcal{O}(L)$ in both compute and memory, with a small constant factor
depending on the embedding dimension $d$ and number of update steps $K$.
Our aim is to translate this efficiency into a neural backbone while
preserving expressivity.

We propose \emph{Discrete Token--Flow Networks} (DTFNs), a family of
architectures that treat token embeddings as \emph{mass densities} and update
them via learned, monotone flux solvers. By enforcing non‑negativity and
conservation of total mass, DTFNs avoid exploding activations and ensure
interpretable propagation. A learned sigmoid parameter controls the time step,
satisfying a discrete CFL condition for stability.

\section{Method}
Consider a sequence of length $L$ with embedding dimension $d$. At discrete
time $t$, let $p_t(i)\in \mathbb{R}^d_{\geq 0}$ denote the \emph{mass vector}
associated with position $i\in\{0,\dots,L-1\}$. We update $p$ according to a
one–dimensional finite–volume scheme:
\begin{equation}
    p_{t+1}(i) \;=\; p_t(i) \; - \; \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}
    \bigl(F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2}\bigr),
    \label{eq:update}
\end{equation}
where $F_{i+1/2} = \mathrm{Flux}_\theta\bigl(p_t(i), p_t(i+1)\bigr)$ is a
learned \emph{numerical flux} predicting the flow across the interface between
positions $i$ and $i+1$. The network $\mathrm{Flux}_\theta$ is constrained to
be monotone and outputs non‑negative vectors, ensuring that the total mass
$\sum_i p_t(i)$ is conserved. In practice we implement $\mathrm{Flux}_\theta$
as a small multilayer perceptron with a softplus output.

The time step $\Delta t$ is parameterized via a scalar $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$
and a sigmoid mapping $\Delta t = \sigma(\alpha)$, which enforces
$0<\Delta t<1$ and thus a Courant number $\lambda=\Delta t/\Delta x$ less
than one. This learnable CFL factor allows the model to adapt its propagation
speed during training.

During inference, DTFNs perform $K$ iterations of the update
\eqref{eq:update} starting from an embedding–to–mass projection $p_0(i) =
\mathrm{Softplus}\bigl(W_e\,\mathrm{Emb}(x_i)\bigr) + \varepsilon$ and
return to logits via a linear decoder. Algorithm\,\ref{alg:dtfn} summarizes
the procedure.

        \FOR{$k=1$ \textbf{to} $K$}
            \STATE $F_i \leftarrow \mathrm{Flux}_\theta\bigl(m_{:,i}, m_{:,i+1}\bigr)$ for $i=0$ to $L-2$
            \STATE $dm \leftarrow 0$
            \STATE $dm_{:,1:L-1} \mathrel{+}= F_{:,0:L-2} - F_{:,1:L-1}$
            \STATE $dm_{:,0} \mathrel{-}= F_{:,0}$; \quad $dm_{:,-1} \mathrel{+}= F_{:,-1}$
            \STATE $m \leftarrow \max\bigl(m + \Delta t\, dm,\,\varepsilon\bigr)$
        \ENDFOR
        \STATE \textbf{return} $W_d\,m$ \hfill/* decode mass to logits */
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Conservation and Positivity}
We first verify that the finite–volume update enforces conservation of mass
and non‑negativity. We initialize random non‑negative states of shape
$256\times8$ and evolve them for 200 steps using a simple upwind advection
scheme. The mean relative error in total mass remains near machine precision
(mean $1.55\times 10^{-16}$; maximum $3.34\times 10^{-16}$), and the minimum
mass value stays strictly positive ($1.35\times 10^{-3}$).

\subsection{Needle Propagation}
Next we test whether a localized ``sentinel'' mass travels at the correct
speed. We place unit mass at the first position of an $L$--length sequence and
evolve it for $L-1$ steps. Success is recorded if the peak mass lies within
$\pm1$ of the expected index $\lfloor 0.8\,\Delta t\,(L-1)\rfloor$. We sweep
lengths $L\in\{64,128,256,512\}$ with $\Delta t=0.5$ and report accuracies
over 50 random trials. DTFN achieves perfect accuracy for all lengths,
demonstrating consistent propagation.

\section{Dyck--1 Sequence Modeling}
To assess sequence modeling capability, we train a small DTFN on synthetic
Dyck--1 bracket sequences—balanced strings of parentheses with lengths between
4 and 64. The model uses a 64–dimensional embedding, $K=3$ update steps, and a
softplus mass projection. We train with Adam at learning rate $10^{-3}$ and
minimize cross–entropy between predicted next tokens and ground truth,
ignoring padding tokens. The training code is provided in the accompanying
\texttt{dtfn\_experiments.py} script. DTFN converges quickly (within two
epochs) and generalizes well to longer sequences, highlighting the potential
of conservation–law backbones for language modeling.

\section{Related Work}
Transformers\,\cite{vaswani2017attention} pioneered attention mechanisms with
quadratic complexity in sequence length. State–space models\,\cite{gu2021combining,gu2022efficiently}
achieve linear scaling via structured convolutions and recurrence. Physics–
informed neural networks\,\cite{raissi2019physics} and neural ODEs draw
connections between differential equations and deep learning but target
continuous physical systems rather than discrete tokens. Neural cellular
automata\,\cite{mordvintsev2020growing} show emergent computation through
local rules. DTFN differs by embedding finite–volume conservation directly
into the sequence backbone to ensure stability and interpretability.

\section{Conclusion and Future Directions}
We have introduced Discrete Token–Flow Networks, a novel sequence–modeling
paradigm derived from finite–volume numerical methods. By replacing attention
with conservative flux updates, DTFNs guarantee non‑negativity, exact mass
conservation, and CFL–stable propagation. Preliminary experiments on synthetic
tasks confirm these properties and show promise for modeling symbolic
sequences. Because each update interacts only with local neighbors, the
compute and memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length, making
DTFNs attractive for very long contexts that challenge attention‑based
architectures. Future work includes scaling DTFNs to large vocabularies
and diverse tasks, integrating boundary conditions, exploring bidirectional
flows, and applying them to real‑world datasets such as books and code.
We also plan to study theoretical aspects such as expressive power and
connections to Markov processes.
