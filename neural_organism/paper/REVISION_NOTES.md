# Revision Notes — 2025-08-18

- Introduced a **runtime-first** architecture with 12 enforceable primitives (CPCS, LoT, RoI‑S, IGMS, TTC, PSC‑CR, KVT‑P, IDS, CSS, SCCH, POPB, CS‑WIF).
- Added concrete **interfaces, enforcement hooks, and acceptance tests** for CPCS, RoI‑S, and TTC.
- Included **code snippets** for RoI Splicing and Two‑Phase Tool Calls.
- Outlined a **fast validation plan** with measurable metrics.
- Clarified why a “smart LLM allocator” cannot subsume these mechanisms: they require **OS/runtime/hardware** control and **verifier‑bound signals**.
