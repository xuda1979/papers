## ⚠️ NOTES FOR AUTHORS

1. **Long paper:** This is a substantial paper. CMP publishes long papers but may request reduction. Be prepared to move technical details to supplementary material if requested.

2. **Conditional results:** The paper clearly distinguishes between conditional and unconditional results (Path A vs Path B for mass inequality). This transparency is important for referee evaluation.

3. **External dependencies:** The paper explicitly lists external results used (Han-Khuri, Dain-Reiris, AMO, Mars-Simon, Lockhart-McOwen). Ensure all citations are accurate.

4. **Scope limitations:** The paper clearly states what is proven (axisymmetric, vacuum exterior) vs what remains open (general case). This helps set appropriate referee expectations.
