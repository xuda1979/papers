\textbf{Acknowledgments.} The author is grateful to Marcus Khuri for valuable discussions on the Jang equation approach, and to the anonymous referees for careful reading and suggestions that significantly improved the exposition. In particular, the explicit derivation of the refined Bray--Khuri identity for axisymmetric data (Lemma~\ref{lem:refined-bk}) and the axis regularity conditions (AR1)--(AR3) were added in response to referee comments.
