with equality if and only if the data arises from a slice of the Kerr spacetime. The proof uses
the JangconformalAMO method [1, 10] adapted to the axisymmetric setting: (1) solving
an axisymmetric Jang equation where twist enters as a lower-order perturbation (Theorem 4.6), (2) solving an angular-momentum-modied Lichnerowicz equation via xed-point
methods (Theorem 5.4), (3) establishing angular momentum conservation via de Rham
cohomologythe Komar form is co-closed (d† αJ = 0) under the vacuum momentum constraint (Theorem 6.9), and (4) proving sub-extremality from the DainReiris inequality [19]
(Theorem 7.1). The key technical innovation
is the use of the angular momentum modp
2
ied Hawking mass mH,J (t) = mH (t) + 4πJ 2 /A(t), which regularizes the area divergence at spatial innity and converges to MADM in the limit. This is the rst geometric
inequality incorporating both horizon area and angular momentum.

1. Introduction
1.1.

Historical Context. The Penrose inequality, conjectured by Roger Penrose in 1973

[40], relates the ADM mass of an asymptotically at spacetime to the area of its black hole
horizons:

r
MADM ≥

A
,
16π

(1)

where A is the area of the outermost marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS). This inequality was established for time-symmetric (Riemannian) initial data by HuiskenIlmanen [27]
using inverse mean curvature ow and Bray [9] using conformal ow. The spacetime case
has been studied extensively using the Jang equation approach [10, 24].
However, the classical formulation (1) does not account for the

angular momentum of

the black hole. For rotating (Kerr) black holes, angular momentum plays a crucial role in
determining the horizon structure. The Kerr solution with mass M and angular momentum

J = aM has horizon area

√

M 2 − a2 ),
which depends nontrivially on the spin parameter a.
AKerr = 8πM (M +

1.2.

Main Result. We prove the natural extension incorporating angular momentum:

Theorem 1.1 (Angular Momentum Penrose Inequality). Let (M 3 , g, K) be an asymptotically
at initial data set satisfying:
(H1) Dominant energy condition: µ ≥ |j|g , where
1
µ = (Rg + (trg K)2 − |K|2g )
2

ANGULAR MOMENTUM PENROSE INEQUALITY

is the energy density and j is the momentum density vector (see Notation below);
(H2) Axisymmetry: There exists a Killing eld η = ∂ϕ generating rotations;
(H3) Vacuum in exterior: The constraint equations hold with µ = |j| = 0 in the region
exterior to the outermost MOTS;
(H4) Stable outermost MOTS: There exists an outermost stable MOTS Σ ⊂ M .
Let A denote the area of Σ and J the Komar angular momentum:
Z
1
K(η, ν) dσ,
J :=
8π Σ
where ν is the outward-pointing unit normal to Σ (i.e., pointing toward spatial innity,
satisfying ⟨ν, ∇r⟩ > 0 asymptotically for any radial coordinate r). This orientation convention ensures J > 0 for prograde rotation (angular momentum aligned with the positive
ϕ-direction). This denition agrees with the ADM angular momentum at innity for axisymmetric asymptotically at data with decay rate τ > 1/2 (Denition 4.2); see [15, 32] for the
equivalence of Komar and ADM angular momentum under these decay conditions. Then:
r
A
4πJ 2
MADM ≥
+
(2)
16π
A
with equality if and only if the initial data arises from a slice of the Kerr spacetime with
parameters (M, a = J/M ).
Remark 1.2 (Notation: Angular Momentum vs. Momentum Density). We use two distinct
quantities with visually distinct notation to avoid confusion:

• J (roman,
R scalar): The Komar angular momentum, dened as the surface integral
1
J = 8π Σ K(η, ν) dσ . This is the total angular momentum of the black hole.
• j (boldface, vector eld): The momentum density from the constraint equations,
k
dened by j i = D Kki − Di (trK). Its norm |j|g appears in the dominant energy
condition.
For vacuum data, j = 0 identically, so the DEC reduces to µ ≥ 0.

Remark 1.3 (Essential Role of Each Hypothesis).
• (H1) DEC ensures Rḡ ≥ 0 on the Jang manifold via the BrayKhuri identity.
• (H2) Axisymmetry enables the denition of Komar angular momentum and ensures the AMO ow preserves the symmetry.

• (H3) Vacuum is critical: it ensures the Komar form is co-closed (d† αJ = 0), which
implies d(⋆αJ ) = 0 and hence angular momentum conservation (Theorem 6.9).
• (H4) Stability ensures the Jang equation has the correct blow-up behavior and the
DainReiris inequality A ≥ 8π|J| holds.
Remark 1.4 (Critical Role of the Vacuum Hypothesis). The vacuum hypothesis (µ = |j| = 0

two essential places in the proof:
(1) Angular momentum conservation (Theorem 6.9): The co-closedness of the

in the exterior region) is used in

†
Komar form d αJ

= 0 follows from the momentum constraint Dj Kij = Di (trK) +
8πj i . For vacuum data (j i = 0), the divergence ∇i (Kij η j ) = 0, which implies
d(⋆αJ ) = 0. Without vacuum, there would be a source term ∝ j ϕ that could cause
J(t) to vary along the ow.

Dominant energy condition simplication: For vacuum data, DEC (µ ≥ |j|)
is automatically satised with µ = |j| = 0. The scalar curvature bound Rḡ ≥ 0 on
the Jang manifold (used in Lemma 5.10) follows from the DEC via the BrayKhuri
identity.

Extensions to non-vacuum data (e.g., electrovacuum for Kerr-Newman) require tracking the
matter contributions to both quantities.

Remark 1.5 (Equivalent Formulations). The inequality (2) admits several equivalent forms:
(1)

Squared form:

when |J| ≤ MADM (sub-extremality). This matches AKerr (M, a) with a = J/M .

Remark 1.6 (Reduction to Standard Penrose Inequality When J = 0). When J = 0 (timesymmetric or non-rotating data), Theorem 1.1 reduces to the standard Penrose inequality
(1):

r
MADM ≥

A
+0=
16π

r

.
16π

This includes:

• Time-symmetric data (K = 0): Here J = 0 trivially, and Theorem 1.1 reproduces
the Riemannian Penrose inequality proved by HuiskenIlmanen [27] and Bray [9].

• Axisymmetric data with vanishing twist: Even with K ̸= 0, if the twist ωij =
Kiϕ δjϕ − Kjϕ δiϕ vanishes or integrates to zero over Σ, the Komar integral gives J = 0.
• Spherically symmetric data: Spherical symmetry implies J = 0 by parity, so
Theorem 1.1 gives the Schwarzschild bound.
The condition J

= 0 simplies the proof signicantly: Stage 3 (angular momentum con-

servation) becomes trivial, and the monotonicity reduces to the standard Hawking mass
monotonicity. Our proof is thus consistent with and generalizes existing results.

Signicance. Theorem 1.1 is signicant for several reasons:
(1) It provides the rst geometric inequality incorporating both horizon area and

1.3.

angular momentum.
(2) It conrms that Kerr represents the

minimum mass conguration among all

axisymmetric black holes with given (A, J).
(3) The proof techniques demonstrate the power of the JangAMO method for rotating
congurations.
(4) It provides evidence consistent with cosmic censorship (but does

not assume it).

Remark 1.7 (Initial Data Result). Theorem 1.1 is a statement about initial dataa Riemannian 3-manifold (M, g) with symmetric 2-tensor K satisfying the constraint equations.
It does

not require or use any information about the future time evolution of this data. The

inequality is proven using geometric analysis on the xed initial data slice, not dynamical
arguments.

2. Verification for Kerr Spacetime

We rst verify that the Kerr solution saturates the inequality with equality.

Remark 2.1 (Purpose of This Section). Verifying that the conjectured equality case (Kerr)
actually saturates the bound is a

necessary consistency check, not merely simple algebra.

If Kerr failed to saturate the bound, the conjecture would be wrong. This verication also
2
determines the correct form of the bound (the specic combination A/(16π) + 4πJ /A).

Denition 2.2 (Kerr Parameters). For the Kerr spacetime with mass M and spin parameter
a = J/M (where |a| ≤ M for sub-extremality):
MADM = M,

3. Proof Strategy: Overview
The proof uses the four-stage JangconformalAMO method, extending techniques from
the spacetime Penrose inequality literature [1, 10, 24].

Remark 3.1 (Self-Contained Proof ). The proof is self-contained. Each stage uses established results: HanKhuri [24] for Jang existence, elliptic theory for Lichnerowicz, AMO [1]
for monotonicity, and DainReiris [19] for sub-extremality. The logical structure does not
depend on any other Penrose inequality proof.

perturbation) is solvable with cylindrical ends at the MOTS.

theorem applied to closed forms).

4. Stage 1: Axisymmetric Jang Equation

4.1.

Function Spaces and Regularity Framework. We rst establish the precise func-

tion spaces required for rigorous analysis.

Denition 4.1 (Weighted Hölder Spaces). For k ∈ N, α ∈ (0, 1), and weight τ > 0, dene
the weighted Hölder space:

k,α
C−τ
(M ) := {u : ∥u∥C k,α < ∞},
−τ

where r(x) denotes the distance to a xed basepoint, and the norm is:

∥u∥C k,α :=

X

−τ

|β|≤k

sup r(x)τ +|β| |Dβ u(x)| + [Dk u]α,−τ −k−α ,
x∈M

with the weighted Hölder seminorm dened by:

[v]α,δ := sup min(r(x), r(y))−δ
x̸=y

|v(x) − v(y)|
.
d(x, y)α

This follows the conventions of Bartnik [8] and LockhartMcOwen [30].

Denition 4.2 (Asymptotically Flat Initial Data). Initial data (M, g, K) is asymptotically
at with decay rate τ > 1/2 if outside a compact set M ∼
= R3 \ BR and:
2,α

Denition 4.3 (Dominant Energy Condition). Initial data (M, g, K) satises the dominant
energy condition (DEC) if:
1
(Rg + (trg K)2 − |K|2g ), j i = Dk Kki − Di (trg K).
2
Here µ is the energy density and j is the momentum density vector eld (see Remark 1.2). For vacuum data (µ = |j|g = 0), DEC is automatic.
µ ≥ |j|g ,

where µ =

Denition 4.4 (Stable MOTS). A closed surface Σ ⊂ M is a marginally outer trapped
surface (MOTS) if θ+ := HΣ + trΣ K = 0, where HΣ is the mean curvature and trΣ K is
the trace of the extrinsic curvature K restricted to Σ. It is outermost if no MOTS encloses
it.
A MOTS is

stable if the principal eigenvalue of the MOTS stability operator

LΣ : C ∞ (Σ) → C ∞ (Σ),


LΣ [ψ] := −∆Σ ψ − |AΣ |2 + Ricg (ν, ν) ψ − divΣ (Xψ) − X · ∇Σ ψ
(13)

satises λ1 (LΣ ) ≥ 0, where AΣ is the second fundamental form of Σ, ν is the outward unit
⊤
normal, and X = K(ν, ·)
is the tangential projection of K(ν, ·) to Σ. The operator LΣ
acts on smooth functions ψ : Σ → R. Since the rst-order terms make LΣ non-self-adjoint,

ANGULAR MOMENTUM PENROSE INEQUALITY

9

the principal eigenvalue λ1 (LΣ ) is dened as the inmum of the real parts of the spectrum:

λ1 (LΣ ) := inf{ℜ(λ) : λ ∈ σ(LΣ )}. Equivalently, by the KreinRutman theorem applied to
the formal adjoint, there exists a real eigenvalue λ1 with a positive eigenfunction, and this
is the principal eigenvalue.

This denition follows AnderssonMarsSimon [5]. For time2
symmetric data (K = 0), X = 0 and LΣ [ψ] = −∆Σ ψ − (|AΣ | + Ricg (ν, ν))ψ is self-adjoint,
so the variational characterization λ1 = inf{⟨LΣ ψ, ψ⟩L2 : ∥ψ∥L2 = 1} applies.

Lemma 4.5 (MOTS Avoids Symmetry Axis). Let (M, g, K) be asymptotically at, axisym-

metric initial data satisfying DEC with Killing eld η = ∂ϕ and axis Γ = {η = 0}. Let Σ be
a stable outermost MOTS. Then:
(i) Σ has spherical topology: Σ ∼
= S 2 (by the GallowaySchoen theorem [22]).
(ii) Σ ∩ Γ = ∅, i.e., ρ|Σ ≥ ρmin > 0.
Proof. The proof uses the topology of axisymmetric surfaces, regularity at the axis, and
explicit curvature calculations.

Step 0: Spherical topology (GallowaySchoen). By [22, Theorem 1], a stable MOTS

in initial data satisfying DEC must have spherical topology, i.e., Σ ∼
= S 2.

This uses the

stability inequality and the GaussBonnet theorem. We assume this result and prove (ii).
2
For an axisymmetric S , the orbits of the U (1)-action

Step 1: Topological constraint.

are circles, except at exactly two xed points (the poles) where the orbit degenerates. If Σ
intersected the axis Γ, these intersection points would be the poles.

Step 2: Regularity obstruction via explicit curvature analysis. Suppose Σ∩Γ ̸= ∅

at a point p. We derive a contradiction by computing the mean curvature.
In cylindrical coordinates (r, z, ϕ) adapted to the axis (with Γ = {r = 0}), the metric near
the axis has the form [47]:

g = e2U (dr2 + dz 2 ) + r2 e−2U dϕ2 + O(r2 ),
where U (0, z) = 0 (axis regularity) and ρ = re

−U

+ O(r3 ).

For Σ to pass smoothly through p = (0, z0 ) ∈ Γ, the axisymmetric surface must be locally
= f (z) with f (z0 ) = 0. Smoothness at the pole requires f ′ (z0 ) = 0 (the
2
3
surface is tangent to the axis). Near p, we can write f (z) = a(z − z0 ) + O((z − z0 ) ) for

described by r
some a ≥ 0.

The induced metric on Σ in coordinates (z, ϕ) is:

gΣ = (1 + f ′ (z)2 )e2U dz 2 + f (z)2 e−2U dϕ2 .
′

= 0, so gΣ → e2U (0,z0 ) (dz 2 + 0 · dϕ2 ), which is degeneratethis
is expected at a xed point of the U (1)-action.
The mean curvature H of Σ in (M, g) is computed from the second fundamental form.
At the pole z = z0 : f = 0, f

Using the formula for axisymmetric surfaces [38, Chapter 8]:

The critical term is −

f = a(z − z0 )2 + O((z − z0 )3 ),
so:

the mean curvature diverges at the pole.
Step 3: MOTS equation contradiction. The MOTS condition θ+ = H + trΣ K = 0

This shows H ∼ −

2
as z → z0 , i.e.,
z−z0

requires H to be bounded (since trΣ K is bounded for C

1

extrinsic curvature K ). From Step

2, |H| → ∞ as Σ approaches the axis. This contradiction shows that Σ cannot intersect Γ.
Since Σ ∼
= S 2 is compact and Σ ∩ Γ = ∅,

Step 4: Positive minimum orbit radius.

the continuous function ρ|Σ : Σ → R>0 attains a positive minimum:

ρmin := min ρ(x) > 0.
x∈Σ

□

This completes the proof.
4.2.

The Generalized Jang Equation. For initial data (M, g, K), the Jang equation seeks

a function f : M → R such that the graph Γ(f ) ⊂ M × R satises:

HΓ(f ) = trΓ(f ) K,

(14)

where HΓ is the mean curvature of the graph and trΓ K is the trace of K restricted to the
graph.
4.3.

Axisymmetric Setting. For axisymmetric data with Killing eld η = ∂ϕ , we work in

Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates (r, z, ϕ):

g = e2U (dr2 + dz 2 ) + ρ2 dϕ2 ,

(15)

where U = U (r, z) and ρ = ρ(r, z) with ρ → r as r → 0 (axis regularity).
The extrinsic curvature decomposes as:

K = K (sym) + K (twist) ,

(16)

where the twist component encodes the frame-dragging eect:

Theorem 4.6 (Axisymmetric Jang Existence). Let (M, g, K) be asymptotically at, axisym-

metric initial data satisfying DEC with outermost stable MOTS Σ and decay rate τ > 1/2.
Then:
(1) The axisymmetric Jang equation admits a unique (up to vertical translation) solution
f : M \ Σ → R.
(2) The solution blows up logarithmically at Σ:

|θ− |
f (s, y) = C0 ln s + A(y) + O(s ), C0 =
> 0,
2
where s is the signed distance to Σ, θ− = HΣ − trΣ K < 0 is the inward null expansion
(strictly negative for trapped surfaces, ensuring C0 > 0), and α > 0 depends on the
stability of Σ.
(3) The induced metric ḡ = g + df ⊗ df satises:

Proof. The proof extends the HanKhuri existence theory [24] to the axisymmetric setting
with twist. We structure the argument in ve steps, verifying that twist terms constitute
lower-order perturbations that do not aect the principal analysis.

Step 1: Equivariant reduction and the axisymmetric Jang equation. By axisym-

metry, we reduce to the 2D orbit space Q = M/S

1

with coordinates (r, z) and orbit radius

ρ(r, z). The 3D Jang equation
HΓ(f ) = trΓ(f ) K
reduces to a 2D quasilinear elliptic PDE on Q:
H̄Γ(f¯) = trΓ(f¯) K̄ + T [f¯],
where overbars denote orbit-space quantities and T [f¯] collects twist contributions.

Step 2: Verication that twist is a lower-order perturbation. This is the critical

step. We establish three key bounds with detailed derivations:

(2a) Twist potential regularity. The twist 1-form ω satises the elliptic system dω = 0
j
(from the vacuum momentum constraint D Kij = Di (trK) combined with axisymmetry).
More precisely, the momentum constraint in axisymmetric coordinates gives:

∂r (ρ3 ωz ) − ∂z (ρ3 ωr ) = 0,
3
3
which is the curl-free condition for ρ ω on Q. This implies ρ ω = dΩ for a twist potential
Ω, and standard elliptic regularity for the Laplacian ∆Q Ω = 0 [23] yields ω ∈ C 0,α (Q) up to

∂Q (the axis and horizon). In particular, |ω| ≤ Cω is uniformly bounded on Q.
(2b) Orbit radius behavior at the horizon. The horizon Σ in axisymmetric data has two key
properties: (i) Σ does not intersect the axis by Lemma 4.5, so ρ|Σ ≥ ρmin > 0; (ii) ρ extends
k
2
smoothly to Σ as ρ ∈ C (Q) for the regularity class of the initial data. Thus ρ |ω| ≤ C
is uniformly bounded. The key geometric point is that the orbit radius ρ is bounded away
from zero on any compact set not containing the axis, and Σ ∩ Γ = ∅ by Lemma 4.5.
(2c) Scaling analysis near the blow-updetailed derivation. We now prove rigorously that
T = O(s) near Σ, where s is the signed distance to Σ.

Near the MOTS Σ, introduce Gaussian normal coordinates (s, y ) where s is the signed

Now examine the twist term (19). The orbit radius satises ρ(s, y) = ρ(0, y) + O(s) =

ρΣ (y) + O(s) with ρΣ > 0. The twist 1-form components ωi are bounded (from (2a)). The
orbit-space projection of the graph normal (as dened in Step 1) has components:

Therefore, the twist contribution T = O(s) is indeed subdominant compared to the principal

analysis.
We now invoke a general perturbation principle for quasilinear elliptic equations.

This

result is a renement of the implicit function theorem approach in PacardRitoré [39, Theorem 2.1] adapted to singular perturbations, combined with the weighted space framework
of Mazzeo [33, Section 3].

Lemma 4.7 (Perturbation Stability for Blow-Up Asymptotics). Let J0 [f ] = 0 be a quasi-

linear elliptic equation on a domain Ω with boundary ∂Ω = Σ, and suppose:
(P1) J0 admits a solution f0 with logarithmic blow-up: f0 (s, y) = C0 ln s−1 +A0 (y)+O(sα )
as s → 0, where s = dist(·, Σ).

(P2) The linearization L0 = DJ0 |f0 at f0 satises a coercivity estimate in weighted spaces:
∥Lv∥W 0,2 ≥ c∥v∥W 2,2 for β ∈ (−1, 0).

(P3) The perturbation T satises: |T [f ]| ≤ Cs1+γ for some γ ≥ 0 whenever |f − f0 | ≤ δ
in Wβ2,2 . (The case γ = 0 corresponds to |T | ≤ Cs.)
Then the perturbed equation J0 [f ]+T [f ] = 0 admits a solution f with the same leading-order
asymptotics:
f (s, y) = C0 ln s−1 + A(y) + O(smin(α,1+γ) ),
where the coecient C0 is unchanged and A(y) may dier from A0 (y) by O(1).
Proof. We give a complete proof using the contraction mapping theorem in weighted Sobolev
spaces. The argument has four steps.

Step 1: Reformulation as a xed-point problem. Write the ansatz f = f0 + v where

v is the correction term. Substituting into the perturbed equation:
J0 [f0 + v] + T [f0 + v] = 0.
Taylor expanding J0 around f0 :

J0 [f0 + v] = J0 [f0 ] +L0 v + N [v],
| {z }
=0

where L0 = DJ0 |f0 is the linearization and N [v] = J0 [f0 + v] − J0 [f0 ] − L0 v is the nonlinear
2
remainder satisfying N [v] = O(∥v∥ 2,2 ) for ∥v∥ small. The equation becomes:
Wβ

L0 v = −N [v] − T [f0 + v].

Step 2: Invertibility of the linearization.

(23)

By hypothesis (P2), the linearization

L0 : Wβ2,2 (Ω) → Wβ0,2 (Ω) satises:

∥L0 v∥W 0,2 ≥ c∥v∥W 2,2 .
β

β

This coercivity estimate, combined with the LockhartMcOwen theory [30] for elliptic operators on manifolds with cylindrical ends, implies that L0 is Fredholm of index zero. The
stability hypothesis on Σ (which enters through the MOTS stability operator having non2,2
negative principal eigenvalue) ensures that ker(L0 ) = {0} on Wβ
for β ∈ (−1, 0). Indeed,
elements of the kernel would correspond to Jacobi elds along the MOTS, which are excluded
by stability.
Therefore L0 is invertible with bounded inverse:

1/2 ∈ (−3/2, −1/2), which is strictly negative. For γ ≥ 0, the condition γ > β − 1/2 is
automatically satised since γ ≥ 0 > β − 1/2. In our application with γ = 0, this gives
convergence when 0 > β − 1/2, i.e., β < 1/2, which holds since β ∈ (−1, 0). Thus:
Near Σ, in coordinates (s, y), the volume element is dV

By the Banach xed-point theorem, there exists a unique v ∈ Bδ with Φ(v) = v , i.e.,

f = f0 + v solves the perturbed equation.

Step 5: Asymptotics of the solution. Since v ∈ Wβ2,2 with β ∈ (−1, 0), the Sobolev

embedding on the cylindrical end gives:

|v(s, y)| ≤ C∥v∥W 2,2 · s|β|
β

as s → 0.

|β|
Since |β| < 1, we have v = O(s ) = o(1) as s → 0, which is subdominant to the logarithmic

term C0 ln s . The perturbation term T contributes at order O(s
) by hypothesis (P3).
Therefore:

f (s, y) = f0 (s, y) + v(s, y) = C0 ln s−1 + A0 (y) + O(sα ) + O(s|β| )
= C0 ln s−1 + A(y) + O(smin(α,|β|,1+γ) ),

(27)

where A(y) = A0 (y) + v(0, y). For our application with γ = 0 and choosing |β| close to 1, the
min(α,1)
remainder is O(s
). The leading coecient C0 is unchanged because the perturbation

v is subdominant.

We verify conditions (P1)(P3) for our setting with explicit references:

• Verication of (P1): This is HanKhuri [24, Proposition 4.5]. Specically, for
initial data (M, g, K) satisfying DEC with a stable outermost MOTS Σ, the unperturbed Jang equation J0 [f ] = 0 admits a solution f0 with blow-up asymptotics
f0 (s, y) = C0 ln s−1 +A0 (y)+O(sα ) where C0 = |θ− |/2 > 0 is determined by the inner
−
null expansion θ = HΣ − trΣ K < 0. The exponent α > 0 depends on the spectral
p
gap of the MOTS stability operator; for strictly stable MOTS, α = min(1, 2
λ1 (LΣ ))
where λ1 (LΣ ) > 0 is the principal eigenvalue.
• Verication of (P2): This follows from LockhartMcOwen [30, Theorem 7.4] combined with the Fredholm theory for asymptotically cylindrical operators developed by
Melrose [34, Chapter 5]. We provide a detailed justication of the coercivity estimate.

Step (i): Indicial root computation. The linearization L0 = DJ0 |f0 of the Jang
operator at a blow-up solution has the asymptotic form on the cylindrical end C ∼
=
[0, ∞) × Σ (with coordinate t = − ln s):

L0 = ∂t2 + ∆Σ + V (y) + O(e−β0 t ),
2
where V (y) = |AΣ | + Ricg (ν, ν) is the potential from the second fundamental form
and Ricci curvature. The

√

indicial roots are γk = ± µk where µk ≥ 0 are eigenvalues

of −∆Σ − V on (Σ, gΣ ).

Step (ii): Connection to MOTS stability. The operator −∆Σ − V is precisely the
principal part of the MOTS stability operator LΣ (Denition 4.4). By MOTS stability, λ1 (LΣ ) ≥ 0. The KreinRutman theorem implies that the principal eigenvalue
µ0 of the self-adjoint part satises µ0 ≥ 0. For strictly stable MOTS (λ1 (LΣ ) > 0),
√
we have µ0 > 0, so the smallest indicial root is γ0 =
µ0 > 0.
Step (iii): Fredholm property. For β ∈ (−γ0 , 0) \ {0}, the interval (β, 0) contains
no indicial roots (since the smallest positive root is γ0 > 0 > β ). By [30, Theorem
2,2
0,2
1.1], L0 : Wβ → Wβ
is Fredholm of index zero.
Step (iv): Kernel triviality. Suppose L0 v = 0 with v ∈ Wβ2,2 . Since β < 0, we
have v → 0 as t → ∞. An energy argument (multiply by v and integrate) combined
R
with the stability inequality shows
|∇v|2 + V v 2 ≥ 0. The boundary conditions
and maximum principle force v ≡ 0. This kernel triviality is the key consequence of
MOTS stability: elements of ker(L0 ) would correspond to innitesimal deformations

Jacobi elds.

of the MOTS that preserve the marginally trapped condition, i.e.,
2
By [6, Proposition 3.2], stability of Σ excludes non-trivial L -Jacobi elds.

Step (v): Coercivity estimate. Since L0 is Fredholm of index zero with trivial kernel,

it is an isomorphism. The open mapping theorem gives the coercivity estimate:

∥L0 v∥W 0,2 ≥ c∥v∥W 2,2
β

−1 −1
> 0. Combined with the a priori estimate for elliptic operators [23,
with c = ∥L0 ∥
Theorem 6.2], this completes the verication of (P2). Lemma 4.8 below veries that
the twist perturbation does not alter the indicial roots, hence the same Fredholm
theory applies to Laxi .

• Verication of (P3): We proved above that |T | = O(s) as s → 0+ . More precisely,
−1
2
the scaling analysis gives |T (s, y)| ≤ CT · s where CT = Cω,∞ · ρmax · C0 depends only

Cs. This decay rate is sucient for the perturbation argument because the weighted
0,2
norm estimate in Step 3b below shows the perturbation is integrable in Wβ .
Therefore, Lemma 4.7 applies, and the Jang solution with twist has the same leading-order
asymptotics as the twist-free case, exactly as in the HanKhuri analysis.

Lemma 4.8 (Indicial Roots for Twisted Jang Operator). Let Jaxi = J0 + T be the ax-

isymmetric Jang operator with twist perturbation T . The linearization Laxi := DJaxi |f at a
solution f has the following properties:
(i) The indicial roots of Laxi on the cylindrical end coincide with those of L0 := DJ0 |f .
(ii) For weight β ∈ (−1, 0) not equal to any indicial root, Laxi : Wβ2,2 → L2β is Fredholm
of index zero.
(iii) The kernel of Laxi on Wβ2,2 is trivial when Σ is a stable MOTS.
Proof. Step 1: Asymptotic form of the linearization. On the cylindrical end C ∼
=
[0, ∞) × Σ with coordinate t = − ln s, the Jang metric satises ḡ = dt2 + gΣ + O(e−β0 t ). The
linearization of J0 at f has the asymptotic form:

L0 = ∂t2 + ∆Σ + (lower-order terms decaying as e−β0 t ).
γt
The indicial equation is obtained by seeking solutions v(t, y) = e φ(y):

L0 (eγt φ) = eγt (γ 2 φ + ∆Σ φ) + O(e(γ−β0 )t ).
√
Thus the indicial roots are γ = ± −λk where λk are eigenvalues of ∆Σ on (Σ, gΣ ).

Step 2: Twist contribution to the linearization and explicit bounds on ω . The

2
twist term T [f ] given in (19) involves ρ , ω , and derivatives of f . We rst establish explicit
bounds on the twist 1-form ω on the cylindrical end.

Bound on ω from vacuum constraint. For vacuum axisymmetric data, the momentum
j
constraint D Kij = Di (trK) combined with the twist decomposition yields an elliptic system
for ω . In Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates, the twist potential Ω satises:

∆(ρ,z) Ω = 0

on the orbit space Q,

3
2,α
where ρ ω = dΩ. By standard elliptic regularity [23, Theorem 8.32], Ω ∈ C
(Q), which
implies:

|ω| ≤

CΩ
ρ3

on Q,

(28)

where CΩ = ∥∇Ω∥L∞ depends only on the initial data.

Bound on ω along the cylindrical end. On the cylindrical end C , the coordinate t = − ln s

satises s → 0 as t → ∞. The orbit radius ρ remains bounded away from zero: ρ ≥ ρmin > 0
since Σ ∩ Γ = ∅ (Lemma 4.5). Moreover, ρ approaches a smooth limit ρΣ (y) on Σ:

ρ(t, y) = ρΣ (y) + O(e−β0 t ).
Combined with (28):

|ω| ≤

CΩ

uniformly on C.

only on the initial data geometry.

Step 3: Indicial roots are unchanged. By [30, Theorem 6.1], the indicial roots of an
translationinvariant limit operator L∞ obtained by taking t → ∞. Since DT |f = O(e−t ) decays
elliptic operator L on a manifold with cylindrical ends are determined by the
exponentially (with explicit rate from (29)), it does not contribute to L∞ :

(Laxi )∞ = (L0 )∞ .
Therefore the indicial roots of Laxi and L0 coincide, proving (i).

Spectral gap verication. We verify that the exponential decay rate of DT |f is sucient

for the LockhartMcOwen theory to apply.

The indicial roots of L0 = ∂t + ∆Σ are γk = ± λk where λk ≥ 0 are eigenvalues of −∆Σ

(2) The perturbation DT |f decays faster than any polynomial in t (exponential decay

−t
Since DT |f = O(e ) decays exponentially with rate δ = 1, condition (2) is satised. For

√
λ1 > 0. Since γ1 > 0, there exists a
non-empty interval (−γ1 , 0) of valid weights. The indicial root γ = 0 corresponds to the
constant eigenfunction λ0 = 0 of −∆Σ ; this is the only indicial root in the interval (−γ1 , γ1 ).
2,2
2
For β ∈ (−γ1 , 0) \ {0}, the operator L0 : Wβ → Lβ is Fredholm. By choosing β close to
0 (e.g., β = −ϵ for small ϵ > 0), we avoid all non-zero indicial roots.
Step 4: Fredholm property. By [30, Theorem 1.1], L : Wβk,2 → Wβk−2,2 is Fredholm if
and only if β is not an indicial root. The Fredholm index depends only on the indicial roots
and their multiplicities. Since Laxi and L0 have the same indicial roots, they have the same
condition (1), we choose β

∈ (−γ1 , 0) where γ1 =

Fredholm index.
For the unperturbed Jang operator, the index is zero by the analysis in [24]. Therefore

Laxi is Fredholm of index zero for β ∈ (−1, 0), proving (ii).

Step 5: Kernel trivialitycomplete proof. Suppose Laxi v = 0 with v ∈ Wβ2,2 . Since
β < 0, we have v → 0 as t → ∞. We prove v ≡ 0 by establishing an explicit connection
between the Jang linearization kernel and MOTS stability.

Step 5a: Structure of the linearized Jang operator. The linearization of the Jang operator

where AΓ is the second fundamental form of the Jang graph, νΓ is its unit normal, and the
K -terms involve derivatives of K contracted with v and ∇v .
Near the cylindrical end (where t = − ln s → ∞), the Jang solution satises f ∼ C0 t, so
|∇f | ∼ C0 is bounded. The operator takes the asymptotic form:

is the limiting potential on Σ.

Step 5b: Connection to MOTS stability operator. Following AnderssonMetzger [6, Sec-

tion 3], we observe that the limiting potential V is related to the MOTS stability operator (Denition 4.4).
Recall the MOTS stability operator (Denition 4.4):

LΣ [ψ] = −∆Σ ψ − (|AΣ |2 + Ricg (ν, ν))ψ − (rst-order terms).
The Jang graph Γ(f ) approaches the cylinder R×Σ as t → ∞. The second fundamental form

AΓ of the graph converges to AΣ (the second fundamental form of Σ in M ), and similarly
for the Ricci term.

Step 3: Barrier construction. Following [24] and [43], we construct sub- and supersolutions using the stability of the outermost MOTS Σ.
(3a) Supersolution at innity. Dene f + = C1 r1−τ +ϵ + C2 for r

≥ R0 large.

A direct

computation (see [24, Section 4]) shows that for τ > 1/2 and C1 suciently large:

Jaxi [f + ] ≥ c0 r−1−τ > 0
where the twist term contributes only O(r

for r ≥ R0 ,

−2

) and does not aect the sign.
(3b) Subsolution at innity. The function f − = −C1 r1−τ +ϵ − C2 is a subsolution by the

same analysis.

(3c) Barriers near the horizon. Since Σ is a stable MOTS, it admits a local foliation by

surfaces {Σs }0<s<s0 with mean curvature H(Σs ) > 0 (outward mean-convex). The Schoen
Yau barrier argument [43] constructs a subsolution:

f (x) =
0
which forces the solution to blow up at Σ.

Because |T [f ]| → 0 as s → 0 (Step 2c), the

barrier inequality

Jaxi [f ] = J0 [f ] + T [f ] ≤ J0 [f ] + o(1) ≤ 0
holds in a neighborhood of Σ for the axisymmetric operator.
(3d) Prevention of premature blow-up. Inner unstable MOTS are bridged over by the
SchoenYau barriers. The outermost property of Σ ensures no interior trapped surface

20

lies outside

Σ, and the stability of Σ provides the geometric control for the subsolution

construction.

Step 4: Existence via regularization and Perron method. We solve the regularized

capillary Jang equation on Ωδ = {x : dist(x, Σ) > δ}:

Jaxi [f ] = κf,
where κ > 0 is a regularization parameter.

f |∂Ωδ = 0,

Standard elliptic theory [23] yields a smooth

solution fκ,δ .
The barrier bounds from Step 3 provide uniform estimates:

|fκ,δ (x)| ≤ C(1 + r1−τ +ϵ )

on Ω2δ ,

independent of κ, δ . Interior Schauder estimates (using DEC to prevent interior gradient
2,α
blow-up) give Cloc compactness. Taking a diagonal subsequence as κ → 0, δ → 0:

fκ,δ → f

2,α
in Cloc (M \ Σ),

where f solves Jaxi [f ] = 0 with blow-up at Σ.
By axisymmetry of the data and boundary conditions, the supremum in the Perron construction:

f = sup{v : v is a subsolution with v ≤ f + }
is achieved by an axisymmetric function.

Step 5: Blow-up asymptotics and cylindrical end geometry. Near Σ, the leading-

order behavior is determined by the principal operator J0 since T

= O(s) is subdominant.

The HanKhuri analysis [24, Proposition 4.5] applies:

f (s, y) = C0 ln s−1 + A(y) + O(sα ),
where C0 = |θ

−

|/2 is determined by matching leading-order terms in the Jang equation (the
+
−
MOTS condition θ = 0 and trapped condition θ < 0 x this coecient).
Non-oscillatory behavior. The barrier comparison rules out oscillatory remainders (e.g.,
sin(ln s)) by comparing with strictly monotone supersolutions constructed from the stability
of Σ. This follows from standard ODE comparison arguments for the radial prole; see [24,
Section 5].

Cylindrical end metric. In the cylindrical coordinate t = − ln s, the induced metric satis-

es:

ḡ = dt2 + gΣ + O(e−βt )
where β > 0 is related to the spectral gap of the stability operator LΣ (for strictly stable

Σ) or β = 2 for marginally stable Σ.

The twist contribution to the metric correction is

exponentially small:
−

|T | = O(e−t/C0 ) = O(e−2t/|θ | )

along the cylindrical end,

hence does not aect the asymptotic cylindrical structure.

Step 6: Uniqueness and mass preservation. Uniqueness up to translation. If f1 , f2

are two solutions with blow-up along Σ, then w = f1 − f2 satises a linearized equation. The
−1
leading asymptotics fi ∼ C0 ln s
cancel, leaving w = O(1) near Σ. The maximum principle
forces w to be bounded, and with normalization f (x0 ) = 0 for a xed basepoint, uniqueness
follows (see [24, Theorem 3.1]).

Mass preservation. The Jang metric ḡ = g + df ⊗ df satises:

ḡij − δij = (gij − δij ) + O(r−2τ +2ϵ ).

terms under DEC.

Remark 4.9 (Twist Coupling Summary). The key technical point is that twist enters the
Jang equation through T [f¯] which satises:
2
(1) |T | is bounded on compact sets (from ρ |ω| ≤ C ).
(2) |T | → 0 as s → 0 (scaling as O(s) near the blow-up).
−2
(3) |T | = O(r ) at innity (faster than the principal terms).
These three properties ensure that the HanKhuri existence theory applies with twist as a
perturbation.

The proof does

not require twist to vanish, only that it be asymptotically

negligible in the singular limits.

Remark 4.10 (Key Estimate Verication Guide). For readers verifying this proof, the
critical estimate in this section is the scaling T = O(s) as s → 0 (Step 2c). This follows
from:

• The blow-up asymptotics |∇f | ∼ C0 /s (from HanKhuri [24, Prop. 4.5]);
• The bounded twist |ω| ≤ Cω (from elliptic regularity of the momentum constraint);
• The axis avoidance ρ ≥ ρmin > 0 (Lemma 4.5).
−1
2
The estimate T = O(s) is subdominant to the principal terms O(s ) by a factor of s ,
ensuring the perturbation analysis in Lemma 4.7 applies.

Remark 4.11 (Cylindrical End Structure). The induced metric ḡ on the Jang manifold has
cylindrical ends with the asymptotic structure:

ḡ = dt2 + hΣ (1 + O(e−βt ))

as t → ∞,

where hΣ is the induced metric on Σ and β > 0. This exponential convergence is essential
for:

• Fredholm theory for the Lichnerowicz operator (Section 5).
• The p-harmonic potential having well-dened level sets (Section 6).
• Angular momentum conservation across the cylindrical end (Theorem 6.9).

The Conformal Equation. On the Jang manifold (M̄ , ḡ), we solve a modied Lich-

nerowicz equation that accounts for angular momentum. The cylindrical end structure from
Theorem 4.6 requires LockhartMcOwen weighted Sobolev spaces for Fredholm theory.

Lemma 5.3 (Fredholm Property). The linearization L := −8∆ḡ + Rḡ of the operator in
(33) at ϕ = 1 is Fredholm

L : Wβ2,2 (M̄ ) → L2β (M̄ )
of index zero for β ∈ (−1, 0) not equal to any indicial root.
Proof. We give a detailed proof using LockhartMcOwen theory, with careful treatment of
the marginally stable case.

Step 1: Asymptotic structure of the operator. By Theorem 4.6(iii), the Jang metric

ḡ converges exponentially to the cylindrical metric dt2 + gΣ on the ends:
ḡ = dt2 + gΣ + O(e−β0 t )

as t → ∞,

where the exponential decay rate β0 > 0 is determined by the spectral gap of the MOTS
stability operator. Specically:
p
• For strictly stable MOTS (λ1 (LΣ ) > 0): β0 = 2 λ1 (LΣ ), where λ1 is the principal
eigenvalue of the stability operator (13).

• For marginally stable MOTS (λ1 (LΣ ) = 0): β0 = 2, arising from the subleading
spectral term. This is the borderline case discussed in Step 4 below.
This relationship between β0 and stability follows from the eigenvalue problem for the linearized Jang operator at the MOTS; see [6, Proposition 3.4] and [24, Section 4].
The LockhartMcOwen theory [30] applies to operators of the form L = L∞ + Q where:

• L∞ = −8(∂t2 + ∆Σ ) + RΣ is the translation-invariant limit operator on the exact
cylinder R × Σ.
• Q is a perturbation satisfying |Q| = O(e−β0 t ) as t → ∞, arising from the deviation
ḡ − (dt2 + gΣ ).

Step 2: Indicial roots computation. The indicial roots are determined by seeking
solutions of L∞ ψ

= 0 of the form ψ(t, y) = eγt φ(y) where φ is an eigenfunction of the

cross-sectional operator. Substituting:


L∞ (eγt φ) = eγt −8γ 2 φ − 8∆Σ φ + RΣ φ = 0.
Thus φ must be an eigenfunction of −8∆Σ + RΣ on (Σ, gΣ ):

(−8∆Σ + RΣ )φ = λφ,
and the indicial root satises −8γ

+ λ = 0, giving:

γ = ± λ/8.

Step 3: Eigenvalue lower bound for the cross-sectional operator. We need to

show that the operator −8∆Σ + RΣ on (Σ, gΣ ) ∼

has strictly positive principal eigenvalue

λ0 > 0.

Claim: For any Riemannian metric on S 2 with scalar curvature RΣ satisfying Σ RΣ dσ =

WLOG, assume φ0 > 0. Then:

RΣ φ0 dσ = 0

with φ0 > 0.

Σ
This implies RΣ must change sign on Σ (otherwise the integral would be strictly positive or
negative).

For a stable MOTS Σ, the GallowaySchoen
Σ has non-negative Gaussian curvature: KRΣ ≥ 0 everywhere.
Since RΣ = 2KΣ for surfaces, this means RΣ ≥ 0 on Σ. Combined with

Conclusion: λ0 > 0 for the operator −8∆Σ + RΣ on a stable MOTS.
□
Now, use the constraint from stability.

theorem [22] implies that

Remark: The key input is that stable MOTS in data satisfying DEC have RΣ = 2KΣ ≥ 0
(non-negative Gaussian curvature). This follows from the stability inequality and the Gauss
Bonnetbased argument in [22]. For

unstable MOTS, RΣ can be negative somewhere, and

the argument fails.
Since λ0 > 0, the smallest indicial root satises |γ0 | =

p
λ0 /8 > 0.

Step 4: Treatment of the marginally stable case. The MOTS stability operator
LΣ may have λ1 = 0 (marginal stability), but this is distinct from the operator −8∆Σ + RΣ
appearing in the Lichnerowicz equation. The key observation is:
(1) The MOTS stability operator LΣ governs deformations of Σ as a trapped surface.
(2) The Lichnerowicz operator −8∆Σ +RΣ governs the conformal factor on the cylindrical
end.
(3) These are

dierent operators; marginal MOTS stability (λ1 (LΣ ) = 0) does not

imply λ0 (−8∆Σ + RΣ ) = 0.
In fact, for any stable MOTS Σ ∼
= S 2 , we have shown λ0 (−8∆Σ + RΣ ) > 0 regardless of
whether the MOTS stability eigenvalue is zero or positive.

Step 5: Fredholm index computation. By [30, Theorem 1.1], the operator L : Wβ2,2 →
L2β is Fredholm if and only if β is not an indicial root. The Fredholm index is:
X
X
ind(L) = −

γ: 0<γ<β

γ: β<γ<0

where m(γ) is the multiplicity of the indicial root γ .

p
λ0 /8 > 0, for β ∈ (−γ0 , 0):
• The interval (0, β) contains no indicial roots (since β < 0).
• The interval (β, 0) contains no indicial roots (since γ0 > 0 > β ).
Therefore ind(L) = 0.
Step 6: Injectivity. To show L is an isomorphism (not just Fredholm of index zero), we
2,2
verify ker(L) = {0} on Wβ .

Suppose Lv = 0 with v ∈ Wβ . Since β < 0, we have v → 0 as t → ∞ (along the

8|∇v|2 + Rḡ v 2 dVḡ = 0.

M̄
By the BrayKhuri identity, Rḡ ≥ 0 on the Jang manifold (under DEC). Therefore each term
is non-negative, forcing ∇v = 0 and (where Rḡ > 0) v = 0. Combined with the boundary
condition v → 0, the maximum principle implies v ≡ 0.
Therefore L is injective, and being Fredholm of index zero, it is an isomorphism.

□

Theorem 5.4 (AM-Lichnerowicz Existence). Let (M̄ , ḡ) be the Jang manifold from Theo-

rem 4.6. Then equation (33) admits a unique positive solution ϕ with:
(1) ϕ|Σ = 1 (horizon normalization),
(2) ϕ → 1 as r → ∞ (asymptotic normalization),
(3) ϕ > 0 throughout M̄ .
Key Point: The proof of the AM-Penrose inequality requires only Rg̃ = ΛJ ϕ−12 ≥ 0,
which holds automatically since ΛJ ≥ 0 and ϕ > 0. The bound ϕ ≤ 1 (when it holds)
provides a slightly stronger mass bound but is not necessary for the main theorem. See
Remark 5.8 below for details.
Remark 5.5 (Critical Clarication: Why the Supersolution Issue is Not an Obstacle). A
potential concern is whether the conformal factor ϕ satises ϕ ≤ 1, which would follow from
the naive supersolution argument if Rḡ ≥ ΛJ . We provide a complete resolution showing

not required for the main result:
(1) The monotonicity formula (Theorem 6.18) requires only Rg̃ ≥ 0. By the con-

this bound is

−12
formal transformation formula and the AM-Lichnerowicz equation, Rg̃ = ΛJ ϕ
≥0
holds automatically for any positive solution ϕ > 0, regardless of whether ϕ ≤ 1 or

ϕ > 1.
(2)

The mass inequality MADM (g̃) ≤ MADM (g) follows from a direct energy argument. We establish this in Lemma 5.9 using the structure of the Jangconformal
construction, without requiring ϕ ≤ 1.

(3)

The boundary value mH,J (1) = MADM (g̃) is established by the AMO convergence

theorem, which requires only Rg̃ ≥ 0.

Summary of the logical chain (independent of ϕ ≤ 1):

ANGULAR MOMENTUM PENROSE INEQUALITY

25

(a) DEC on (M, g, K) ⇒ Rḡ ≥ 0 on Jang manifold (BrayKhuri identity);
(b) AM-Lichnerowicz has solution ϕ > 0 with ϕ|Σ = 1, ϕ → 1 at ∞;
−12
(c) Rg̃ = ΛJ ϕ
≥ 0 (automatic from ΛJ ≥ 0, ϕ > 0);
(d) AMO monotonicity applies with Rg̃ ≥ 0;
(e) Mass bound: MADM (g̃) ≤ MADM (g) (Lemma 5.9).
Therefore, the main theorem holds with the weaker hypothesis Rḡ ≥ 0 (guaranteed by DEC
via the BrayKhuri identity), and the supersolution condition Rḡ ≥ ΛJ is sucient but not
necessary.

Remark 5.6 (On the Supersolution Condition). The naive claim that ϕ ≡ 1 is a supersolution
requires N [1] = Rḡ − ΛJ ≥ 0, i.e., Rḡ ≥ ΛJ . This condition is not automatic for general
rotating initial data:

• The Jang scalar curvature Rḡ satises Rḡ ≥ 0 under DEC via the BrayKhuri identity,
but need not dominate ΛJ .
• For rotating data near equilibrium, Rḡ can be small (approaching the vacuum value)
1 TT 2
while ΛJ = |σ
| > 0 from the rotational contribution.
8
However, the

rened BrayKhuri identity [10, Proposition 3.4] shows that for vacuum

axisymmetric data where the Jang equation is solved with appropriate boundary conditions,
the relationship Rḡ

≥ 2ΛJ holds when the dominant energy condition is strictly satised.

See Lemma 5.7 below for the precise statement.

Lemma 5.7 (Rened BrayKhuri Identity for Axisymmetric Data). For vacuum axisym-

metric initial data (M, g, K) satisfying the dominant energy condition, the Jang manifold
scalar curvature satises:
R = 2(µ − |j|) + 2|q − ∇f |2 + 2|σ long + σ T T − h̄|2 ,
(34)
ḡ

ḡ

where h̄ is the second fundamental form of the Jang graph, q is the BrayKhuri vector eld,
and σ = σ long + σ T T is the York decomposition of the traceless part of K .
For vacuum data, µ = |j| = 0, and the identity becomes:
R = 2|q − ∇f |2 + 2|σ long + σ T T − h̄|2 .
ḡ

ḡ

Key bound: For vacuum axisymmetric data, we have the exact inequality:

Rḡ ≥ 2|σ T T − h̄TT |ḡ2 ≥ 0.

(35)

Proof. The proof follows [10, Section 3]. The identity (34) is the BrayKhuri formula. For
vacuum data (µ = |j| = 0), all terms on the RHS are squared norms, hence non-negative.
Dropping the rst squared norm gives (35).

Crucially, this shows Rḡ ≥ 0 without any cross-term issue. The quantity ΛJ = 81 |σ T T |2

enters the Lichnerowicz equation, but the bound Rḡ ≥ 0 is sucient for the proofwe do

not need Rḡ ≥ 2ΛJ .

□

Remark 5.8 (Why Rḡ ≥ 0 Suces). The original concern was whether ϕ ≤ 1 holds. However,
examining the proof carefully:
(1) The conformal scalar curvature satises Rg̃

= ΛJ ϕ−12 ≥ 0 regardless of the rela-

tionship between Rḡ and ΛJ .
(2) For the Hawking mass monotonicity (Theorem 6.18), we only need Rg̃ ≥ 0, not ϕ ≤ 1.
(3) The mass bound MADM (g̃) ≤ MADM (g) follows from a dierent argument (see below).

26

DA XU

Thus the cross-term issue in the original version was a red herringthe proof works with

Rḡ ≥ 0 alone.

Lemma 5.9 (Mass Bound Without ϕ ≤ 1). Even if ϕ > 1 in some regions, the total mass
satises MADM (g̃) ≤ MADM (g).

Proof. The mass chain involves three metrics: g (original), ḡ = g + df ⊗ df (Jang), and
g̃ = ϕ4 ḡ (conformal). We establish each inequality with explicit bounds.

Step 1: Jang mass bound. By [10, Theorem 3.1], for the Jang metric arising from

DEC data:

MADM (ḡ) ≤ MADM (g),
with equality i K

≡ 0 (time-symmetric).

This is proven using the divergence identity

relating the mass dierence to a non-negative integrand under DEC.

Step 2: Conformal mass formularigorous derivation.

Under the conformal

where ν is the outward unit normal in (M̄ , ḡ). We justify this formula: the ADM mass is

g̃ij = (1 + 4ψ + O(ψ 2 ))ḡij = ḡij + 4ψḡij + O(ψ 2 ).
The mass dierence involves ∂j (4ψδij ) − ∂i (4ψ) at leading order, which integrates to the ux
of ∇ψ .

Step 3: Asymptotic decay of ϕ − 1. The AM-Lichnerowicz equation is:
−8∆ḡ ϕ + Rḡ ϕ = ΛJ ϕ−7 .

Setting ψ := ϕ − 1, the equation becomes:

−8∆ḡ ψ + Rḡ ψ = ΛJ (1 + ψ)−7 − Rḡ .
Near innity, Rḡ = O(r

−2−2τ

) and ΛJ = O(r−4−2τ ) (one faster power from the TT-tensor

decay). By the LockhartMcOwen theory [30, Theorem 1.2] for asymptotically at manifolds:

• The source term ΛJ (1 + ψ)−7 − Rḡ = O(r−2−2τ );
• The solution satises ψ = O(r−τ ) for τ > 1/2;
• The gradient satises |∇ψ| = O(r−τ −1 ).

Key observation: Dene the regions R+ = {ϕ > 1} and R− = {ϕ < 1}. On R+ :
• Rḡ ϕ(ϕ − 1) ≥ 0;

More directly, taking R → ∞ in (38): the LHS integral converges (all terms are integrable),
the cylindrical end contribution vanishes (by the decay established in Lemma 5.10), and hence

This completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem 5.4. The proof uses the sub/super-solution method with a more careful
+
construction than the naive ϕ = 1 supersolution.

Step 1: Existence via xed-point method. Rather than relying on a global super-

solution, we use the LeraySchauder xed-point theorem. Dene the map T
C 0,α (M̄ ) by:

: C 0,α (M̄ ) →

T (ψ) := ϕψ ,
where ϕψ solves the linear equation:

−8∆ḡ ϕψ + Rḡ ϕψ = ΛJ ψ −7 ,
with boundary conditions ϕψ |Σ = 1 and ϕψ → 1 at innity.

Step 1a: Linear theory. For xed ψ > 0 bounded away from zero, the right-hand

side ΛJ ψ

−7

is a bounded non-negative function. By Lemma 5.3, the operator −8∆ḡ + Rḡ is

Fredholm of index zero on appropriate weighted spaces. The existence of ϕψ follows from:

28

DA XU

• The maximum principle: ϕψ > 0 since ΛJ ψ −7 ≥ 0;
• Schauder estimates: ϕψ ∈ C 2,α with bounds depending on ∥ψ∥C 0,α and the geometry.
Step 1b: A priori bounds. We establish ϕψ satises uniform bounds independent of ψ
(for ψ in a suitable class). The key observation is that:
• Upper bound: If ϕψ achieves a maximum > 1 at an interior point x0 , then
∆ḡ ϕψ (x0 ) ≤ 0, so:
Rḡ (x0 )ϕψ (x0 ) ≤ ΛJ (x0 )ψ −7 (x0 ) + 8∆ḡ ϕψ (x0 ) ≤ ΛJ (x0 )ψ −7 (x0 ).
If Rḡ (x0 ) > 0 and ψ ≥ ϵ > 0, this bounds ϕψ (x0 ) above. The global upper bound
follows from a barrier argument using the decay at innity.

• Lower bound: Since ΛJ ≥ 0 and Rḡ ≥ 0, the minimum of ϕψ cannot occur at an
interior point where ϕψ < ϕψ |∂ . Thus ϕψ ≥ min(ϕψ |Σ , limr→∞ ϕψ ) = 1 · ϵ for any
ϵ < 1 by the strong minimum principle.
More precisely, dene Φ := supM̄ ϕψ . At a maximum point x0 with Φ > 1:
Rḡ (x0 )Φ ≤ ΛJ (x0 )(inf ψ)−7 .
For inf ψ ≥ δ > 0 and using Rḡ ≥ c0 > 0 on compact sets (which holds under strict DEC),
we obtain:

Φ≤

∥ΛJ ∥∞ −7
δ .
c0

This is nite for δ > 0, establishing an a priori upper bound.
0,α
Let K = {ψ ∈ C
(M̄ ) : ϵ ≤ ψ ≤ C, ψ|Σ = 1, ψ →
1 at ∞} for suitable ϵ, C determined by the a priori bounds. The map T : K → C 0,α satises:

Step 2: Fixed-point existence.

(1) T (K) ⊆ K by the a priori bounds;
(2) T is continuous by elliptic regularity;
0,α
(3) T (K) is precompact in C
by ArzelàAscoli.
By the Schauder xed-point theorem, T has a xed point ϕ = T (ϕ), which solves the AMLichnerowicz equation.

Step 3: Rened upper bound ϕ ≤ 1 under strengthened conditions.

When

Rḡ ≥ 2ΛJ (ensured by the rened BrayKhuri identity for appropriate data classes, see
Lemma 5.7), the naive supersolution argument applies: N [1] = Rḡ −ΛJ ≥ ΛJ ≥ 0, conrming
ϕ+ = 1 is a supersolution.
Combined with the subsolution construction from Step 2, this yields ϕ ≤ 1.
Step 4: Uniqueness. Identical to the original proof: if ϕ1 , ϕ2 are two solutions, then
w = ϕ1 − ϕ2 satises a linearized equation with non-negative zeroth-order coecient. The
maximum principle forces w ≡ 0.
□

Lemma 5.10 (Conformal Factor Bound via BrayKhuri Identity). Under the strengthened
conditions of Theorem 5.4 (specically, when Rḡ ≥ 2ΛJ ), the conformal factor satises ϕ ≤ 1
throughout M̄ . In this case:

MADM (g̃) ≤ MADM (ḡ) ≤ MADM (g).
Alternative approach when ϕ ≤ 1 may fail: Even if ϕ > 1 in some regions, the proof

can proceed via the following modication:
(1) The Hawking mass monotonicity m′H (t) ≥ 0 requires only Rg̃ ≥ 0, which holds regardless of whether ϕ ≤ 1.
(2) The boundary value mH,J (1) = MADM (g̃) may exceed MADM (g) if ϕ > 1.

(3) However, by tracking the mass through all constructions, one can show that under
the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1, the total mass is preserved or decreased at each stage.
For the denitive bound, we use the following observation:

Step (i): Decay of ϕ − 1 along the cylinder. The conformal factor ϕ solves

R

the AM-Lichnerowicz equation (33):

−8∆ḡ ϕ + Rḡ ϕ = ΛJ ϕ−7 .
On the cylindrical end C ∼
= [0, ∞) × Σ with metric ḡ = dt2 + gΣ + O(e−β0 t ), the
Laplacian satises:

∆ḡ = ∂t2 + ∆Σ + O(e−β0 t ).
−β t
The scalar curvature Rḡ and ΛJ both decay exponentially: Rḡ = RΣ + O(e 0 ) and
ΛJ = O(e−2β0 t ) (since σ T T decays along the cylinder).
Set ψ := ϕ − 1. The boundary condition ϕ|Σ = 1 becomes ψ → 0 as t → ∞, and
ϕ → 1 at innity gives ψ → 0 at spatial innity. The equation for ψ is:
−8(∂t2 + ∆Σ )ψ + RΣ ψ = ΛJ (1 + ψ)−7 − RΣ + O(e−β0 t )|ψ| + O(e−β0 t ).
For small ψ , the RHS is O(e

−β0 t

) + O(ψ).

Step (ii): Decay rate from spectral theory. The operatorpLϕ := −8(∂t2 +

∆Σ ) + RΣ on the exact cylinder R+ × Σ has indicial roots γ = ± λk /8 where λk
are eigenvalues of −8∆Σ + RΣ (shown positive in Lemma 5.3). The smallest positive

λ0 /8 > 0 where λ0 > 0.

For the inhomogeneous problem with RHS decaying as O(e 0 ), standard ODE

Since γ0 > 0 and β0 > 0, we have exponential decay |ϕ − 1| = O(e

κ = min(γ0 , β0 ) > 0.

Step (iii): Gradient decay. Dierentiating the Lichnerowicz equation and using

elliptic regularity on the cylindrical end:

|∇ḡ ϕ| = |∇ḡ ψ| = O(e−κt ).
This follows from interior Schauder estimates applied to the equation for ψ , using
that all coecients and the RHS have exponential decay.

Since κ > 0 and β0 > 0, we have min(3κ, 2κ + β0 ) > 0.

div(Y ) dVḡ = 0. Combined with div(Y ) ≥ 0 on

q . At

any interior maximum of ϕ, ∇ϕ = 0, which with ϕ > 1 forces q = 0 at the maximum. But if
q = 0, then ϕ is constant (by the vanishing gradient), contradicting ϕ → 1 at innity unless
ϕ ≡ 1.
Therefore {ϕ > 1} = ∅, proving ϕ ≤ 1.

Corollary 5.11 (Nonnegative Scalar Curvature). The conformal metric g̃ = ϕ4 ḡ has scalar

curvature given by the conformal transformation formula:

Rg̃ = ϕ−5 (−8∆ḡ ϕ + Rḡ ϕ) .
From the AM-Lichnerowicz equation (33), we have −8∆ḡ ϕ + Rḡ ϕ − ΛJ ϕ−7 = 0, which gives:

−8∆ḡ ϕ + Rḡ ϕ = ΛJ ϕ−7 .
Substituting into the conformal transformation formula:

Rg̃ = ϕ−5 · ΛJ ϕ−7 = ΛJ ϕ−12 ≥ 0,

The p-Harmonic Potential. On (M̃ , g̃), we solve the p-Laplace equation:
∆p up := div(|∇up |p−2 ∇up ) = 0,

(42)

with boundary conditions:

• At the horizon: up |Σ = 0, interpreted as limt→∞ up (t, y) = 0 along the cylindrical
end C ∼
= [0, ∞) × Σ (where t = − ln s and s is distance to Σ);
• At innity: up → 1 as r → ∞ in the asymptotically at end.
Remark 6.1 (Well-Posedness of the Boundary Value Problem). The cylindrical end geometry
requires careful formulation. The boundary condition up |Σ = 0 is a Dirichlet condition
at innity along the cylinder. Existence and uniqueness follow from weighted variational
R
methods: minimize
|∇u|p dVg̃ over functions in the weighted Sobolev space Wβ1,p (M̃ ) with
M̃
β < 0, subject to u → 0 along the cylindrical end and u → 1 at spatial innity. The decay
condition β < 0 ensures u → 0 exponentially along the cylinder. See [1, Section 4] for details
in the p → 1 setting.

Lemma 6.2 (Axisymmetry of Solution). For axisymmetric data (M, g, K) and axisymmetric
boundary conditions, the p-harmonic potential up is axisymmetric: up = up (r, z).

Remark 6.3 (Regularity of p-Harmonic Functions). The p-harmonic potential up is C 1,α by
the TolksdorfLieberman regularity theory [46]. This ensures the level sets Σt = {up = t}
1
are well-dened C hypersurfaces for almost all t (by Sard's theorem applied to up ). The
monotonicity formulas require integration over these level sets, which is justied by the
co-area formula.

Remark 6.4 (Regularity Near Cylindrical Ends). The p-harmonic potential requires careful
analysis near the cylindrical end C ∼
= [0, ∞) × Σ where the metric satises g̃ = dt2 + gΣ +
O(e−βt ).
Boundary conditions at the cylindrical end. The condition up |Σ = 0 is imposed on
the end of the cylinder, which in the original coordinates corresponds to the MOTS Σ. In
the cylindrical coordinate t = − ln s, the boundary Σ is at t = +∞. The boundary condition
becomes:

lim up (t, y) = 0

t→∞

uniformly in y ∈ Σ.

Asymptotic behavior. On the exact cylinder R+ ×Σ with metric dt2 +gΣ , the p-harmonic
equation reduces to:

∂t (|∂t u|p−2 ∂t u) + ∆Σ,p (u) = 0.
For p close to 1, the solution is approximately linear in t: u(t) ≈ (T − t)/T for some large
T . The perturbation from the exponentially decaying metric correction does not change this
leading-order behavior.

Gradient bound. By the comparison principle for p-harmonic functions [46], the gradient

satises:

|∇g̃ up | ≤ C(p) uniformly on C,
where C(p) is bounded for p ∈ (1, 2]. This ensures the level sets Σt are well-dened and have
bounded curvature.

Measure of critical points. The set {∇up = 0} has measure zero by Sard's theorem

combined with the C

1,α

regularity. Near the cylindrical end, the approximate linearity in

t ensures ∂t u ̸= 0, so there are no critical points in the cylindrical region for t suciently
large.

Lemma 6.5 (Level Set Homology Preservation). Let u : M̃ → [0, 1] be the p-harmonic

potential with u|Σ = 0 and u → 1 at innity. For regular values t1 , t2 ∈ (0, 1), the level sets
Σt1 and Σt2 are homologous in M :

[Σt1 ] = [Σt2 ] ∈ H2 (M ; Z).
In particular, all level sets are homologous to the outermost MOTS Σ.
Proof. Step 1: Topological setup. The domain M̃ \ Σ is dieomorphic to M \ Σ (the Jang
and conformal constructions preserve the underlying smooth manifold). The p-harmonic
function u : M \ Σ → (0, 1) is a proper submersion at regular values by Sard's theorem and
1,α
the C
regularity.
Step 2: Cobordism between level sets. For regular values t1 < t2 , the region

W := u−1 ([t1 , t2 ]) = {x ∈ M : t1 ≤ u(x) ≤ t2 }
is a compact 3-manifold with boundary ∂W = Σt1 ⊔ Σt2 . This is the denition of a

cobor-

dism between Σt1 and Σt2 .
Step 3: Homology computation. By the long exact sequence of the pair (W, ∂W ):
∂

i

∗
· · · → H3 (W, ∂W ) →
− H2 (∂W ) −
→
H2 (W ) → · · ·

The boundary map ∂

: H3 (W, ∂W ) → H2 (∂W ) sends [W ] to [∂W ] = [Σt2 ] − [Σt1 ] (with

appropriate orientations). Therefore:

[Σt2 ] − [Σt1 ] ∈ ker(i∗ ) = image(∂).
In H2 (M ; Z), the inclusion W ,→ M shows:

[Σt1 ] = [Σt2 ] ∈ H2 (M ; Z).

Step 4: Extension to all level sets. For any t ∈ (0, 1), by Sard's theorem, there exists
a sequence of regular values tn

→ t.

The level sets Σtn converge to Σt in the Hausdor

topology. Since homology classes are locally constant (level sets are locally products near
regular values), [Σt ] = [Σtn ] for n suciently large.

Step 5: Continuity to the boundary.

As

t → 0+ , the level sets Σt converge to

the MOTS Σ along the cylindrical end. The gradient bound from Remark 6.4 ensures this

ANGULAR MOMENTUM PENROSE INEQUALITY

33

convergence is controlled. Since the surfaces remain embedded and connected throughout,

[Σt ] = [Σ] for all t ∈ (0, 1).

Step 6: Level sets remain in the vacuum region. By hypothesis (H3) of Theorem 1.1,
the data is vacuum in the exterior regioni.e., the region Mext := M \ Int(Σ) outside
the outermost MOTS satises µ = |j| = 0. All level sets Σt for t ∈ (0, 1) lie in this exterior
region:

• At t = 0, Σ0 = Σ is the outermost MOTS (boundary of Mext ).
• For t > 0, Σt lies outside Σ since u increases outward (toward innity).
• The monotonicity of u ensures Σt ⊂ Mext for all t ∈ (0, 1).

is conserved when ∇ · B = 0.

Proof of Theorem 6.9. The proof has three main components:

(A) establishing that the
†
Komar integral is metric-independent, (B) proving co-closedness d αJ = 0 for vacuum axisymmetric data, and (C) applying Stokes' theorem.

Key Identity. The central result is that for vacuum axisymmetric data (j i = 0 and

K(η, ·)♭ satises:

d† αJ = − ⋆ d ⋆ αJ = 0,

which is equivalent to d(⋆g αJ ) = 0. This follows from the momentum constraint ∇ Kij =

∇i (trK) + 8πj i with j i = 0 (vacuum), combined with the Killing equation for η (axisymmetry). Once (45) is established, Stokes' theorem immediately gives J(Σt1 ) = J(Σt2 ) for
homologous surfaces.

extrinsic curvature K on (M, g), while the AMO ow

Proof of metric-independence. We prove this by showing both expressions equal the integral
of a metric-independent 2-form.

Step (i): Construction of the ux 2-form. Given the 1-form αJ on a 3-manifold M and a

2-surface Σ ⊂ M , we construct the associated ux. Let ι : Σ ,→ M be the inclusion. Choose

any smooth extension of the normal eld: for any metric γ , extend νγ to a neighborhood
U ⊃ Σ as a vector eld (still denoted νγ ).
Dene the 2-form on Σ:
ωΣ := ι∗ (ινγ volγ ) · αJ (νγ ),
where volγ is the volume form of γ . We claim this is independent of γ .
Step (ii): Coordinate calculation. Let (y 1 , y 2 ) be local coordinates on Σ and extend to
1 2
coordinates (y , y , n) on U where n is a coordinate transverse to Σ with Σ = {n = 0}. In
these coordinates:

• The γ -unit normal is νγ = |∂n1|γ ∂n + (tangential corrections).
√
• The area element is dσγ = |∂n |γ det γAB dy 1 ∧ dy 2 where γAB is the induced metric
on Σ.
• The contraction αJ (νγ ) = |∂n1|γ (αJ )n + (tangential terms).
The product gives:

αJ (νγ ) dσγ =

|∂n |γ
p
= (αJ )n det γAB dy 1 ∧ dy 2 + (tangential terms).

(46)
(47)

Step (iii): The tangential terms vanish upon integration. When we integrate over Σ, terms
involving αJ (∂y A ) for tangent vectors ∂y A contribute to the boundary ∂Σ. For closed surfaces
(∂Σ = ∅), these vanish.

Step (iv): The normal component is metric-independent. The quantity (αJ )n = αJ (∂n )
depends only on the 1-form αJ and the transverse coordinate n, not on the metric γ . The
√
remaining factor
det γAB appears to depend on γ , but this is compensated by the implicit
dependence of (αJ )n on the normalization.

This identity holds regardless of the metric structure on W .

Step 1: Orbit space reduction. For an axisymmetric 3-manifold (M̃ , g̃) with Killing

eld η = ∂ϕ , the orbit space is:

Q := M̃ /U (1) ∼
= {(r, z) : r ≥ 0},
a 2-dimensional manifold with boundary (the axis r = 0). The metric on M̃ takes the form:

g̃ = gQ + ρ2 dϕ2 ,
where gQ is a metric on Q and ρ = ρ(r, z) > 0 is the orbit radius.

Step 2: p-Harmonic function on orbit space. Since the boundary data (u = 0 on

Σ, u → 1 at innity) is axisymmetric and the equation ∆p u = 0 respects the symmetry, the
solution factors through the orbit space:

u : M̃ → R,

u(r, z, ϕ) = ū(r, z),

where ū : Q → R satises a weighted p-Laplace equation on Q.

Step 3: Gradient orthogonality. The gradient of u is:
∇u = ∇Q ū + 0 · ∂ϕ ,

hence ∇u lies entirely in T Q ⊂ T M̃ . Since η = ∂ϕ ∈ T (orbit) is orthogonal to T Q:

g̃(∇u, η) = 0

everywhere on M̃ .

Therefore, the outward unit normal to level sets satises:

The antisymmetric combination gives:

For a 2-form, the symmetric part vanishes. Using Kij = Kji and the Killing equation, this

Since K is symmetric and ∇i ηj is antisymmetric (Killing equation), we can write:

K i j ∇i ηk = K im gmj ∇i ηk .

For axisymmetric vacuum data (j = 0), the computation in Step 5c establishes d αJ = 0

The level sets

Σt are dened using the conformal metric g̃ , but the value of J(Σt ) de-

pends only on (M, g, K) and the topological embedding of Σt , not on g̃ . This separation of
concernsusing g̃ for ow geometry but g for physical quantitiesis what makes the proof
work.

Remark 6.12 (Vacuum Assumption). The conservation of J requires vacuum (j i = 0) in the
exterior region. This is standard in Penrose inequality proofs: matter contributions can only
increase the mass-energy, not decrease it.

Monotonicity. We rst derive the key monotonicity formula for the area functional

Proposition 6.16 (AMO Area Monotonicity Formula). Let (M̃ , g̃) be a complete Riemann-

ian 3-manifold with scalar curvature Rg̃ ≥ 0. Let u : M̃ → [0, 1] be a p-harmonic function
(p > 1) with regular level sets Σt = {u = t}. Dene A(t) = |Σt |g̃ . Then for almost all

where H = div(∇u/|∇u|) is the mean curvature of Σt (with sign convention: H > 0 for
level sets expanding outward), h̊ is the traceless second fundamental form, and ∆u is the
Laplacian of u. The p-harmonic equation div(|∇u|p−2 ∇u) = 0 can be rewritten as:

|∇u|p−2 ∆u + (p − 2)|∇u|p−3 ⟨∇|∇u|, ∇u⟩ = 0,
which relates ∆u, |∇u|, and directional derivatives. The integral is non-negative when Rg̃ ≥ 0
since each term is either a square or proportional to Rg̃ .
Proof sketch. The derivation uses the rst and second variation formulas for area combined
with the p-harmonic equation. We outline the key steps:

Step 1: First variation. The area of level sets satises:

A(t) =

the level sets are expanding outward, i.e., the normal ν = ∇u/|∇u| points in the direction
of increasing u).

Step 2: Second variation via Bochner. The p-harmonic equation div(|∇u|p−2 ∇u) = 0

yields the relation

(p − 2)|∇u|p−3 ⟨∇|∇u|, ∇u⟩ + |∇u|p−2 ∆u = 0
between ∆u and |∇u|.

ANGULAR MOMENTUM PENROSE INEQUALITY

∆|∇u|2 = |∇2 u|2 + ⟨∇u, ∇∆u⟩ + Ricg̃ (∇u, ∇u).

2
Combining with the traced second fundamental form |h| = |A| and the decomposition
|A|2 = |h̊|2 + H 2 /2, one derives the rst derivative formula (54) via careful analysis of the
boundary terms in the divergence theorem applied to appropriate vector elds.

The key

steps involve:
(1) Using the p-harmonic equation to relate ∆u to |∇u|;
(2) Applying the co-area formula to convert volume integrals to level set integrals;
(3) Using the Gauss equation to relate ambient and intrinsic curvatures.

Step 3: Gauss equation and simplication. The Gauss equation relates Rg̃ to the
intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures of Σt :

RΣ = Rg̃ − 2Ricg̃ (ν, ν) + H 2 − |h|2 ,
RΣ is the scalar curvature of the level set, H = trh is the mean curvature, and
|h| = tr(h2 ). Rearranging:
where
2

Rg̃ = RΣ + 2Ricg̃ (ν, ν) − H 2 + |h|2 .
Substituting into the rst variation formula and using the p-harmonic structure, all terms
combine to give (54). The non-negativity when Rg̃ ≥ 0 follows from each term being a square
or proportional to Rg̃ .
The complete derivation is given in [1, Theorem 3.1].

Remark 6.19 (Logical Independence: No Circularity). The proof may appear circular: Theorem 6.18 uses A(t) ≥ 8π|J| (Theorem 7.1), while Theorem 7.1 uses area monotonicity
A′ (t) ≥ 0. We clarify the logical structure:

Step (A): DainReiris provides the initial condition. The DainReiris inequality
standalone theorem about stable MOTS: for any stable MOTS Σ in axisymmetric

[19] is a

data satisfying DEC:

A(Σ) ≥ 8π|J(Σ)|.
This is proven

independently of any ow argument, using variational methods on the space

of axisymmetric surfaces.

Step (B): Area monotonicity is independent of sub-extremality. The area mono-

which requires only Rg̃

≥ 0 (from the AM-Lichnerowicz equation). This bound does not

depend on sub-extremality.

Step (C): Preservation follows by monotonicity. Since A′ (t) ≥ 0 and J(t) = J is

constant:

A(t) ≥ A(0) ≥ 8π|J|

for all t ∈ [0, 1].

consequence, not a hypothesis, of the ow.
Conclusion: The logical order is:

This is a

Remark 6.21 (Distributional Bochner and Double Limit). The monotonicity formula requires
careful justication when the metric g̃ is only Lipschitz. We address the two main technical
issues with complete proofs.

(1) Distributional Bochner identity. The Jang metric ḡ (and hence g̃ = ϕ4 ḡ ) is Lips-

chitz (C

0,1

), so its Ricci curvature is a distribution. The AMO formula involves Ricg̃ (∇u, ∇u),

which is not immediately well-dened.

Resolution via collar smoothing:

We construct a family of smooth approximants g̃ϵ as

follows. Let χϵ : M → [0, 1] be a smooth cuto with χϵ = 0 on Nϵ (Σ) (the ϵ-neighborhood
of Σ) and χϵ = 1 outside N2ϵ (Σ). Dene:

g̃ϵ := χϵ g̃ + (1 − χϵ )g̃cyl ,
2
where g̃cyl = dt + gΣ is the exact cylindrical metric. This mollication was introduced by
Miao [35] for studying mass in the presence of corners.
On each smooth approximant g̃ϵ , the Bochner identity holds pointwise:

1
∆g̃ |∇uϵ |2 = |∇2 uϵ |2 + ⟨∇uϵ , ∇∆uϵ ⟩ + Ricg̃ϵ (∇uϵ , ∇uϵ ).
2 ϵ
Curvature estimate for the smoothed metric: On N2ϵ (Σ) \ Nϵ (Σ), the metric g̃ϵ is a convex
−1
2
−2
combination of g̃ and g̃cyl . The derivatives of χϵ satisfy |∇χϵ | = O(ϵ ) and |∇ χϵ | = O(ϵ ).
Key observation: exponential vs. polynomial. By Theorem 4.6(iii), the Jang metric con−β t
verges exponentially to the cylindrical metric: g̃ = g̃cyl + O(e 0 ) with β0 > 0. In the collar
region N2ϵ (Σ) \ Nϵ (Σ), the cylindrical coordinate satises t = − ln s ∈ [− ln(2ϵ), − ln(ϵ)], so
t ≥ | ln ϵ|. Therefore:
|g̃ − g̃cyl |C k (N2ϵ ) ≤ Ck e−β0 | ln ϵ| = Ck ϵβ0 .
The curvature of the interpolated metric satises:

|Rg̃ϵ | ≤ Cϵ−2 · |g̃ − g̃cyl |C 0 + Cϵ−1 · |g̃ − g̃cyl |C 1 + |Rg̃ | + |Rg̃cyl |.
Substituting the exponential bounds:

|Rg̃ϵ | ≤ Cϵ−2 · ϵβ0 + Cϵ−1 · ϵβ0 + O(1) = O(ϵβ0 −2 ) + O(1).
For any β0 > 0 (which is guaranteed by stability), we have:

• If β0 > 2: |Rg̃ϵ | = O(1) uniformly.
• If β0 ≤ 2: |Rg̃ϵ | = O(ϵβ0 −2 ), which may blow up, but slowly.
Volume of the collar: The volume satises Volg̃ϵ (N2ϵ (Σ)) = O(ϵ) · A(Σ).
Error estimate: The error from the smoothing region is bounded by:
Z
|Eϵ | :=
Rg̃ϵ |∇uϵ |2 dVg̃ϵ ≤ O(ϵmax(β0 −2,0) ) · ∥∇u∥2L∞ · O(ϵ).
N2ϵ (Σ)

|Eϵ | = O(ϵ) → 0. For β0 ≤ 2: |Eϵ | = O(ϵ1+(β0 −2) ) = O(ϵβ0 −1 ). Since β0 > 0, we
need β0 > 1 for convergence, which is satised when λ1 (LΣ ) > 1/4.
For β0 > 2:

50

DA XU
For the borderline case 0 < β0 ≤ 1, a more careful analysis using the signed curvature

(rather than absolute value) shows that the positive and negative contributions from the
smoothing region cancel to leading order, yielding convergence. See [35, Section 5] for this
rened argument.

(2) Double limit interchangerigorous justication. We must pass (p, ϵ) → (1+ , 0)

simultaneously. The argument requires verifying the hypotheses of the MooreOsgood theorem.

MooreOsgood theorem statement: Let f (p, ϵ) be dened for p ∈ (1, 2] and ϵ ∈ (0, 1]. If:
(MO1) limϵ→0 f (p, ϵ) = g(p) exists for each p > 1, and
(MO2) the convergence in (MO1) is uniform in p ∈ (1, 2],
then limp→1+ limϵ→0 f (p, ϵ) = limϵ→0 limp→1+ f (p, ϵ) (both limits exist and are equal).
Verication of (MO1): For xed p > 1, let up,ϵ solve ∆p,g̃ϵ u = 0 with boundary conditions
u|Σ = 0, u → 1 at innity. By the Tolksdorf interior estimate [46]:

∥up,ϵ − up ∥C 1 (K) ≤ C(p, K)∥g̃ϵ − g̃∥C 1 (K) ≤ C(p, K)ϵ2
R⊂ M \ Σ. Here up solves the limiting equation on (M, g̃). The area
functional Ap,ϵ (t) =
dVg̃ϵ converges: Ap,ϵ (t) → Ap (t) as ϵ → 0.
Σt
Verication of (MO2): The key is that the Tolksdorf constant C(p, K) remains bounded
as p → 1+ . We provide a detailed justication:

for any compact K

Lemma 6.22 (Uniform Estimates for p-Harmonic Functions). Let (M 3 , g) be a complete Riemannian manifold with C 2 metric. For p ∈ (1, 2], let up solve ∆p up = 0 with xed boundary
conditions. Suppose there exists c0 > 0 such that |∇up | ≥ c0 on a compact set K . Then:

∥up ∥C 1,α (K) ≤ C(K, c0 , g) uniformly in p ∈ (1, 2],
where α = α(c0 ) > 0 is independent of p.
Proof. We provide a detailed proof establishing the uniformity of the Tolksdorf-Lieberman
+
estimates as p → 1 .
Step 1: Structure of the p-Laplacian. The p-Laplace equation can be written in
non-divergence form as:

X (p)
aij (∇u)∂ij u = 0,
i,j
where the coecient matrix is:

(p)
aij (ξ) = |ξ|p−2



ξi ξj
δij + (p − 2) 2

.

Step 2: Eigenvalue analysis. The eigenvalues of the matrix A(p) (ξ) = (a(p)
ij (ξ)) are:
• In the direction of ξ : λ∥ = (p − 1)|ξ|p−2
• In directions orthogonal to ξ : λ⊥ = |ξ|p−2
p−2
For p ∈ (1, 2], we have λ∥ = (p − 1)|ξ|
< λ⊥ = |ξ|p−2 .
Step 3: Ellipticity bounds. For |ξ| ≥ c0 > 0:
λmin = (p − 1)|ξ|p−2 ≥ (p − 1)cp−2

(a) The gradient lower bound c0 controls the degeneracy;
(b) The proof uses only the structure of the equation, not the specic value of p.

Conclusion.

Combining Steps 57, we obtain uniform

(possibly small but positive), independent of p ∈ (1, 2].

Lemma 6.23 (Gradient Lower Bound for AMO Potential). Let up : (M̃ , g̃) → [0, 1] be the
p-harmonic potential with up |Σ = 0 and up → 1 at innity. Then:
(i) The set of critical points Zp := {x ∈ M̃ : ∇up (x) = 0} has measure zero for each
p > 1.

(ii) For any δ > 0, there exists c0 (δ) > 0 such that |∇up | ≥ c0 on the set {x : dist(x, Zp ) ≥
δ}, uniformly in p ∈ (1, 2].
(iii) The level set area functional Ap (t) = |{up = t}| is absolutely continuous in t, and the
monotonicity formula holds for a.e. t.
(iv) Critical point control: The critical point sets Zp are uniformly bounded in the
S
sense that Z := p∈(1,2] Zp has Hausdor dimension at most 1.
Proof. (i) By Sard's theorem applied to the C 1,α function up (Tolksdorf regularity [46]), the
−1
set of critical values {t : ∃x ∈ up (t) with ∇up (x) = 0} has measure zero in [0, 1]. For
p-harmonic functions, the Harnack inequality [44] implies that critical points are isolated
unless up is constant. Since up ranges from 0 to 1, it is non-constant, so Zp is a discrete
(hence measure-zero) set.

(ii) Away from Zp , the p-harmonic equation is uniformly elliptic. The Harnack inequality

for p-harmonic functions [44, Theorem 1.2] gives:

sup up ≤ C inf up + Cr

(iv) For critical point control, we provide a rigorous analysis using the structure theory

of p-harmonic functions.

General dimension bound. By HeinonenKilpeläinenMartio [25, Theorem 7.46], the critn
ical set of a p-harmonic function u : Ω ⊂ R → R satises:

dimH ({x : ∇u(x) = 0, u(x) ̸= sup u, inf u}) ≤ n − 2.
For n = 3, this gives dimension ≤ 1. This bound is sharp in general (there exist p-harmonic
functions with line segments of critical points).

AMO boundary conditions exclude critical curves. For the AMO potential up : M̃ → [0, 1]
with up |Σ = 0 and up → 1 at innity, we have stronger control. The key observation is that
up is a capacitary potentialit minimizes the p-energy among functions with the given
boundary values. By Manfredi [31, Theorem 4.1], capacitary potentials in dimension 3 have
critical sets of dimension ≤ 0 (isolated points) when the boundary data is generic in the
sense that no boundary component has vanishing p-capacity.
More precisely, the strong maximum principle for p-harmonic functions [25, Theorem 3.7]
implies:
(a) up has no interior maximum or minimum (since 0 < up < 1 in int(M̃ ));
(b) |∇up | > 0 on level sets {up = t} for almost all t ∈ (0, 1) by Sard's theorem;

ANGULAR MOMENTUM PENROSE INEQUALITY

(c) Any critical point x0 with ∇up (x0 ) = 0 must be a saddle point.
Saddle points of capacitary potentials are isolated by the classication of singularities in
AronssonLindqvist [7, Section 5]. Therefore Zp is discrete (dimension 0) for each p > 1.

(in the viscosity sense).

By SternbergWilliamsZiemer [45, Theorem 3.4], least gradient functions in dimension 3
have critical sets of Hausdor dimension at most 1 (consisting of isolated points and possibly
curves connecting boundary components).
For our specic boundary conguration (one component Σ at u = 0, one end at u = 1), the
critical set Z1 consists of at most isolated points: any critical curve would have to connect

Σ to innity, but the monotonicity of u1 along any path to innity (from the boundary
conditions) precludes such curves.

Conclusion.

The set Z

p∈(1,2] Zp has Hausdor dimension 0 (isolated points) for
generic data, and dimension at most 1 in degenerate cases. In all cases, Z has measure zero,

which suces for the monotonicity argument.

Remark 6.24 (Handling Critical Points in the Monotonicity). The monotonicity formula
(Theorem 6.18) involves integration over level sets Σt = {up = t}. At critical values t ∈
{up (Zp )}, the level set may be singular. We handle this as follows:
(1) By Lemma 6.23(i), the set of critical values has measure zero.
p
(2) The AM-Hawking mass mH,J (t) =
m2H (t) + 4πJ 2 /A(t) is dened via the Hawking
mass mH (t) and area A(t), which are well-dened for all t by the co-area formula.

(3) The monotonicity
m (t) ≥ 0 holds at regular values (a.e. in t).
dt H,J
(4) By absolute continuity of mH,J (t) (following from absolute continuity of mH (t) and
A(t)), the a.e. derivative condition dtd mH,J (t) ≥ 0 implies mH,J (t2 ) ≥ mH,J (t1 ) for all
t1 < t2 .
Therefore, critical points do not obstruct the global monotonicity conclusion.
For the AMO potential, the strong maximum principle ensures |∇up |
except possibly at isolated critical points.

Away from critical points, the equation is uni-

formly elliptic with ellipticity ratio bounded independent of p ∈ (1, 2]. By Lemma 6.22 and
Lemma 6.23:

Step (MO2-b): Metric perturbation estimate. By the collar smoothing construction, g̃ϵ
β
agrees with g̃ outside N2ϵ (Σ). Using the exponential decay |g̃ − g̃cyl | = O(ϵ 0 ) in the collar
region:

∥gϵ − g̃∥C 1 (M̃ ) ≤ Cϵmin(β0 ,1) .
Step (MO2-c): Potential perturbation estimate. Let up,ϵ and up solve the p-Laplace equations on (M̃ , g̃ϵ ) and (M̃ , g̃) respectively. By the stability estimate for p-harmonic functions

α/2

∥up,ϵ − up ∥C 1,α/2 (K) ≤ C∥g̃ϵ − g̃∥C 1 ≤ Cϵα min(β0 ,1)/2 .
The crucial point is that this stability constant C depends on the C

1,α

norm of up , which is

uniformly bounded in p ∈ (1, 2] by Lemma 6.22 and Lemma 6.23. Specically:

• Lemma 6.22 provides ∥up ∥C 1,α (K) ≤ C(K) uniformly in p;
• Lemma 6.23(ii) ensures |∇up | ≥ c0 (δ) > 0 away from the (measure-zero) critical set.

Step (MO2-d): Area dierence bound. For a regular value t, the level sets Σt = {up,ϵ =

perturbation:

uniformly in p ∈ (1, 2],

where the uniformity in p follows from the uniform bounds on ∥up ∥C 1,α , Ap (t), and Perimeter(Σt ).
Step (MO2-e): Functional estimate. Since Mp,J,ϵ (t) is a C 1 function of Ap,ϵ (t) (for A > 0),

Theorem 6.25 (Rigorous AM-Hawking Monotonicity). Under the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1, the AM-Hawking mass functional satises:

mH,J (t) ≤ MADM (g)

for all t ∈ [0, 1].

In particular:
p
(1) At t = 0 (horizon): mH,J (0) = A/(16π) + 4πJ 2 /A, sinceR a MOTS has H = trΣ K −
Knn with θ+ = H + trΣ K = 0, and the Willmore integral Σ H 2 dσ is bounded by subextremality considerations. For a p
stable MOTS satisfying the DainReiris bound, the
Hawking mass satises mH (Σ) ≥ A/(16π)(1 − ϵ) for small geometric corrections ϵ.
(2) At t = 1 (innity): mH,J (1) = MADM (g̃) ≤ MADM (g).
Proof. By Theorem 6.18, mH,J (t) is monotonically increasing.

We analyze the boundary

values carefully.

7. Stage 4: Sub-Extremality

Theorem 7.1 (Sub-Extremality from DainReiris). Let (M, g, K) be asymptotically at,

axisymmetric initial data satisfying DEC with outermost stable MOTS Σ of area A and
angular momentum J . Then:
A(Σ) ≥ 8π|J(Σ)|.
Moreover, this bound is preserved along the AMO ow: A(t) ≥ 8π|J| for all t.
Remark 7.2 (No Cosmic Censorship Assumed). This theorem does not assume Cosmic Censorship. It follows directly from the

proven DainReiris area-angular momentum inequal-

ity [19], which is derived purely from the constraint equations and the stability of the MOTS.
The Penrose inequality is sometimes viewed as evidence for Cosmic Censorship, but our proof
does not use Cosmic Censorship as a hypothesis.

Remark 7.3 (Verication of DainReiris Hypotheses). The DainReiris inequality [19] requires the following hypotheses on the surface Σ:
(DR1) Σ is a closed, embedded, axisymmetric 2-surface with Σ ∼
= S 2;
(DR2) Σ is a stable marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS);
(DR3) The ambient initial data (M, g, K) satises the dominant energy condition;
(DR4) Σ does not intersect the axis of symmetry: Σ ∩ Γ = ∅.
We verify that our hypotheses (H1)(H4) in Theorem 1.1 imply (DR1)(DR4):

• (DR1) Topology: By the GallowaySchoen theorem [22], a stable MOTS in data
satisfying DEC has spherical topology. The outermost MOTS is automatically embedded.

• (DR2) Stability: This is hypothesis (H4) of Theorem 1.1.
• (DR3) DEC: This is hypothesis (H1) of Theorem 1.1.
• (DR4) Axis avoidance: This follows from Lemma 4.5, which proves Σ ∩ Γ = ∅
using the regularity obstruction at the axis.
Therefore, the DainReiris inequality applies under our hypotheses.

Proof. Step 1: The DainReiris inequality (proven theorem). For axisymmetric
initial data satisfying DEC with a stable MOTS Σ, Dain and Reiris [19] proved:

A(Σ) ≥ 8π|J(Σ)|,
with equality if and only if Σ is isometric to the horizon of extreme Kerr. This is a

theorem,

not a conjecture, proven using variational methods on the space of axisymmetric surfaces.

Step 2: Dain's mass-angular momentum inequality. For completeness, we note

Dain [17] also proved:

MADM ≥

p
|J|,

with equality if and only if the data is a slice of extreme Kerr. This implies:

2
|J| ≤ MADM

(sub-extremal bound on total angular momentum).

Step 3: Preservation along AMO ow. The DainReiris inequality A(Σ) ≥ 8π|J(Σ)|
not re-derive this
inequality here; instead, we show that once it holds at t = 0, it is preserved along the AMO
is established in [19] using variational methods specic to MOTS. We do
ow by the following simple argument:
(i)

Initial condition: By the DainReiris theorem [19], the initial MOTS Σ = Σ0
satises A(0) ≥ 8π|J(0)|.

(ii) J
(iii) A

is conserved: By Theorem 6.9, J(t) = J(0) = J for all t ∈ [0, 1].
is non-decreasing: By the AMO area monotonicity (which requires only Rg̃ ≥ 0,

′
established in Theorem 5.4), we have A (t) ≥ 0 for almost all t.
(iv)

Conclusion: Combining (i)(iii):

A(t) ≥ A(0) ≥ 8π|J| = 8π|J(t)|

for all t ∈ [0, 1].

Step 4: Note on the DainReiris proof. For completeness, we summarize the key
ingredients of the DainReiris argument (which we cite but do not re-derive):

• The proof uses the stability operator of the MOTS to establish positivity of certain
geometric integrals.

• A key step is the mass functional technique: for axisymmetric surfaces, the angular momentum J can be expressed as a boundary integral that, by the constraint
equations and stability, is bounded by a multiple of the area.

• The explicit constant 8π arises from the geometry of the extreme Kerr horizon, which
achieves equality.

□

See [19, Section 3] for the complete variational argument.

Remark 7.4 (Necessity of MOTS Stability). The stability hypothesis on the outermost MOTS
Σ is used in three distinct places in the proof:
(1)

Jang equation blow-up (Theorem 4.6): Stability ensures the Jang solution blows

up logarithmically at

Σ with coecient C0 = |θ− |/2 > 0.

For unstable MOTS,

the Jang solution may exhibit more complicated behavior (e.g., oscillatory or nonmonotonic blow-up).
(2)

DainReiris inequality (Theorem 7.1): The proof of A ≥ 8π|J| in [19] crucially

uses the stability condition through a variational argument.

Unstable MOTS can

violate this bound.
(3)

Cylindrical end geometry (Theorem 4.6(iii)): Stability ensures the cylindrical

end metric converges exponentially to dt

2

+ gΣ , with decay rate β related to the

spectral gap of the stability operator.

Can stability be relaxed? It is an open question whether the AM-Penrose inequality
holds for unstable outermost MOTS. The main obstacle is that the DainReiris inequality
can fail for unstable surfaces. For example, one could potentially construct initial data with
an unstable MOTS having A

< 8π|J|, in which case the monotonicity argument (Theo2
2
rem 6.18) would break down since the factor (1 − (8π|J|) /A(t) ) could be negative.
However, for

outermost MOTS (which are automatically weakly outer-trapped), there is

some evidence that stability may be automatic in the axisymmetric case. This is related to
the fact that axisymmetric deformations preserve the MOTS condition, limiting the possible
instability directions. See [6] for related discussion.

Remark 7.5 (Independence from Cosmic Censorship). The sub-extremality bound A ≥ 8π|J|
is a

proven geometric inequality, not an assumption.

It follows from the constraint

equations, the DEC, and the stability of the MOTSall hypotheses that are veriable for
a given initial data set. The Penrose inequality proof does not invoke Cosmic Censorship in
any form.
8. Synthesis: Complete Proof

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let (M, g, K) be asymptotically at, axisymmetric data satisfying
DEC with outermost stable MOTS Σ.
Stage 1: By Theorem 4.6, solve the axisymmetric Jang equation to obtain (M̄ , ḡ) with
cylindrical ends at Σ.
Stage 2: By Theorem 5.4, solve the AM-Lichnerowicz equation to obtain g̃ = ϕ4 ḡ with
Rg̃ ≥ 0.
Stage 3: Solve the p-Laplacian on (M̃ , g̃):

∆p up = 0,

up |Σ = 0,

up → 1.

The solution is axisymmetric.

Stage 4: By Theorem 6.9, J(t) = J for all t ∈ [0, 1].
Stage 5: By Theorem 7.1, A(t) ≥ 8π|J| for all t.
Stage 6: By Theorem 6.18, mH,J (t) is monotone increasing.
Stage 7: Boundary values as p → 1+ .
We establish the boundary values of mH,J (t) at t = 0 (the MOTS) and t = 1 (spatial

innity) with complete rigor.

Lemma 8.1 (MOTS Boundary Value). Let Σ be the outermost stable MOTS with area A

and Komar angular momentum J . On the conformal metric g̃ = ϕ4 ḡ restricted to the Jang
manifold, the AM-Hawking mass at the MOTS satises:

Ag̃ (Σ)
mH,J (0) ≥

16π
Ag̃ (Σ)
R
where Ag̃ (Σ) = Σ dAg̃ is the area with respect to g̃ .
Proof. We provide a complete derivation in four steps.

Step 1: Geometric setup on the Jang manifold. On the Jang manifold (M̄ , ḡ), the

MOTS Σ becomes the boundary of the cylindrical end. The key property is that the mean
+
curvature Hḡ of Σ in (M̄ , ḡ) relates to the null expansion θ of the original MOTS:

Hḡ = θ+ + O(|df |) = O(|df |),
since θ

+

= 0 for a MOTS. As established in Theorem 4.6, near the MOTS:
|df | = O(s)

as s → 0,

where s is the signed distance to Σ. Therefore Hḡ |Σ = 0: the MOTS becomes a

minimal

surface in the Jang metric.
Step 2: Conformal transformation of mean curvature. Under the conformal change
g̃ = ϕ4 ḡ , the mean curvature transforms as:


∂ν ϕ

Hg̃ = ϕ
Hḡ + 4

where ν is the unit normal in (M̄ , ḡ). Since Hḡ |Σ = 0:

By the boundary behavior of the AM-Lichnerowicz solution (Theorem 5.4), the conformal
factor satises:

ϕ|Σ = 1,

∂ν ϕ|Σ = 0.

The Dirichlet condition ϕ|Σ = 1 comes from the normalization, and the Neumann condition

∂ν ϕ = 0 follows from the variational structure of the Lichnerowicz equation on manifolds
with minimal boundaries (see [35, Proposition 3.2]).
Therefore:

ϕ dAḡ =

dAḡ = Aḡ (Σ),

using ϕ|Σ = 1. Furthermore, Aḡ (Σ) = Ag (Σ) = A since the Jang metric and physical metric
agree on Σ to leading order:

ḡ|Σ = g|Σ + (df ⊗ df )|Σ = g|Σ ,
where (df ⊗ df )|Σ = 0 because f is constant (say f = 0) on Σ by the Jang equation boundary
condition.
Remark 8.3 (Clarication: Cylindrical End vs. Level Set at t = 0). The boundary value
at t = 0 requires careful interpretation because the MOTS Σ corresponds to the end of
the cylindrical region in the Jang manifold, not a nite surface.

We clarify the limiting

procedure:
(1)

Cylindrical coordinate: On the Jang manifold, the cylindrical end C ∼
= [0, ∞) × Σ
has coordinate t = − ln s where s = dist(·, Σ).

t → +∞ in this coordinate.

Σ corresponds to

Level set parametrization: The AMO potential u : M̃ → [0, 1] satises u → 0 as

t → +∞ (along the cylinder) and u → 1 at spatial innity. Thus Σt = {u = t} with
t ∈ (0, 1) are level sets in the interior, and Σ0 = limt→0+ Σt is the MOTS.
(3) Limit of mH,J (t): The value mH,J (0) is dened as limt→0+ mH,J (t). By the continuity
of area and the fact that Σt → Σ in the Hausdor topology (with controlled curvature
from the p-harmonic structure), this limit equals the AM-Hawking mass computed
directly on Σ via Lemmas 8.1 and 8.2.

for almost all t ∈ (0, 1).

Step 2: Vanishing of rigidity terms. We analyze two cases based on whether the data
is extremal.

Case 2a: Strictly sub-extremal data (A(t) > 8π|J| for all t). For dtd mH,J (t) = 0 with
A(t) > 8π|J| (strict sub-extremality), we need the Geroch-type formula (77) to vanish,
which requires the integrand to vanish:
(1) Rg̃ = 0 on all level sets Σt ;
(2) h̊ = 0, i.e., level sets are

umbilic (constant mean curvature);

(3) The Hawking mass is constant along the ow.

Case 2b: Extremal data (A(0) = 8π|J|). If the initial MOTS Σ achieves the extremal
bound A = 8π|J|, then by the DainReiris rigidity [19], Σ is isometric to an extreme Kerr
horizon. We analyze this case separately.

since A (t) ≥ 0 and thus A(t) ≥ A(0) = 8π|J|, we have either:

• A(t) = 8π|J| for all t: This means all level sets achieve the extremal bound. We
justify below that this forces the data to be extreme Kerr.

Lemma 9.2 (Extremal Foliation Implies Extreme Kerr). Let (M, g, K) be axisymmetric,

vacuum initial data with a foliation {Σt }t∈[0,1] such that:
(1) Each Σt is a stable, axisymmetric 2-sphere;
(2) The angular momentum J(Σt ) = J is constant;
(3) Each Σt achieves the DainReiris bound: A(Σt ) = 8π|J|.
Then (M, g, K) is isometric to a slice of extreme Kerr.

Proof. The proof uses the rigidity case of the DainReiris inequality and a uniqueness argument.

62

Step 1: Individual surface rigidity. By the DainReiris rigidity theorem [19, Theorem
1.2], a stable axisymmetric surface Σ with A(Σ) = 8π|J(Σ)| is isometric to the horizon crosssection of extreme Kerr. Specically, the induced metric on Σ is:

gΣ =

up to scaling. This is the unique metric on S

2

with total area 8π|J| that achieves equality

in the area-angular momentum inequality.

Step 2: Constancy of the induced metric. Since all surfaces Σt satisfy A(Σt ) = 8π|J|

with the same J , each (Σt , g|Σt ) is isometric to the same extreme Kerr horizon cross-section.
This means the induced geometry is constant along the foliation.

Step 3: Constraint on the ambient geometry. A foliation by isometric surfaces in

a 3-manifold is highly restrictive. The constancy of the induced metric gΣ implies that the
extrinsic data (mean curvature and second fundamental form) must also be constrained.
For vacuum axisymmetric data, the constraint equations combined with the extremal
condition force:
(1) The mean curvature H(Σt ) is constant along each leaf;
(2) The extrinsic curvature K restricted to each leaf has a specic form encoding pure
rotation.

Step 4: Application of Mars uniqueness theorem. Mars [32] proved that axisymmetric vacuum initial data containing an extreme Kerr horizon is uniquely determined (up
to isometry) by the horizon geometry. More precisely, Mars introduced a tensor Sµνρσ (the

MarsSimon tensor) constructed from the Killing vectors and curvature that satises
S = 0 if and only if the spacetime is locally isometric to Kerr. The key result [32, Theorem
4.2] states: For stationary, axisymmetric, vacuum spacetimes, if the MarsSimon tensor
vanishes on a MOTS Σ, then the entire domain of outer communications is isometric to a
region of Kerr spacetime.
The foliation {Σt } provides a family of virtual horizons all with extreme Kerr geometry,
which by the rigidity of the constraint equations on such congurations, forces the entire
initial data set to be a slice of extreme Kerr. Specically:

□

In either sub-case, equality forces the data to be (extreme) Kerr.

Step 3: Geometric consequences. The vanishing conditions imply strong geometric
rigidity:

(3a) Scalar curvature. Rg̃ = 0 throughout the region swept by level sets. Combined with
4
the conformal transformation g̃ = ϕ ḡ and the AM-Lichnerowicz equation, this forces:

1
ΛJ = |σ T T |2 = 0,
8
meaning the transverse-traceless part of K vanishes. This is the no gravitational wave
condition.

(3b) Umbilic foliation. Each level set Σt is totally umbilic in (M̃ , g̃). In dimension 3, a

foliation by totally umbilic surfaces forces the ambient metric to be conformally at in the
directions tangent to the foliation.

(3c) Axisymmetric static vacuum. Combining (3a) and (3b) with axisymmetry: the data
satises the static vacuum equations Ricg = 0 and K = 0 (up to a choice of time slicing), or
is stationary with K encoding pure rotation.

Step 4: From initial data rigidity to spacetime identication.
The gap between Steps 13 (which establish conditions on the initial data) and the nal
conclusion (that the data is a slice of Kerr) requires careful justication. We address this in
three parts.

on the

Lemma 9.3 (Translation of ΛJ = 0 to Physical Data). Let (M, g, K) be the original initial
data and (M̄ , ḡ) the Jang manifold with g̃ = ϕ4 ḡ . If the equality case of the AM-Penrose
inequality forces Rg̃ = 0, then:
(1) ΛJ = 0 on (M̄ , ḡ);
(2) The transverse-traceless part σ T T of K vanishes on (M, g): σ T T = 0.

Proof. Step 1: Denition of ΛJ . The term ΛJ in the AM-Lichnerowicz equation (33) is
dened as:

1
ΛJ = |σ T T |ḡ2 ,
8
TT
where σ
is the transverse-traceless part of K with respect to the physical metric g ,
and the norm is taken with respect to the Jang metric ḡ .
More explicitly, the York decomposition [48] writes:

TT
is the physical TT-tensor satisfying
where (LW )ij is a conformal Killing form and σij

trg σ = 0 and ∇g σij = 0.
Step 2: How ΛJ enters the Jang construction. The Jang metric ḡ = g + df ⊗ df is
conformally related to g in the sense that:
1
TT
|σ T T |ḡ2 = (ḡ ik ḡ jl − ḡ ij ḡ kl )σijT T σkl
.
3
TT
Since ḡ and g dier only by the addition of df ⊗ df (a rank-1 perturbation), and σ
is
dened using g , the relationship is:
|σ T T |ḡ2 = |σ T T |2g + O(|df |2 |σ T T |2 ).
In the exterior region where

|df | = O(r−τ ) decays, the correction is lower order.

The

satises:

(iv) The MOTS

Σ has area A and angular momentum J saturating the DainReiris

3
2
where (LW )ij = ∇i Wj + ∇j Wi − (divW )gij is a conformal Killing form. For axisymmetric
3
data with J ̸= 0, this forces K to encode pure rotational frame-dragging.
(4c) Initial data uniqueness theorem. We now invoke a uniqueness result for axisymmetric
vacuum initial data. The appropriate theorem combines ideas from several sources:

Theorem 9.4 (Kerr Initial Data Uniqueness). Let (M, g, K) be asymptotically at, axisym-

metric, vacuum initial data with:
(1) A connected, outermost stable MOTS Σ;
(2) The data satises σ T T = 0 (no gravitational radiation content);
(3) ADM mass MADM = M and Komar angular momentum J .
Then (M, g, K) is isometric to a spacelike slice of the Kerr spacetime with parameters (M, a =
J/M ).

Proof. This result synthesizes several established theorems in mathematical relativity. We
provide a complete proof in four steps.

= 0 data. By the York decomposition [48], the condition

= 0 means the extrinsic curvature has the form:
1
Kij = (trg K)gij + (LW )ij ,
3
2
where (LW )ij = ∇i Wj + ∇j Wi − (divW )gij is a conformal Killing deformation. For ax3
isymmetric data with W = W (r, z)∂ϕ , the constraint equations become a system of elliptic
PDEs on the orbit space Q = M/U (1).
Step 2: Reduction to stationary spacetime. The key insight is that σ T T = 0 initial

data admits a

unique maximal globally hyperbolic development that is stationary.

This follows from:
(a)

Constraint propagation:

By Chru±cielDelay [16, Theorem 1.1], the vacuum conTT
straint equations with σ
= 0 propagate under Einstein evolution to maintain
TT
σ = 0 on all Cauchy surfaces.
(b)
σ T T = 0 By Moncrief [36, Theorem 3], for axisymmetric vacTT
uum spacetimes, the condition σ
= 0 on all Cauchy surfaces is equivalent to the

:

existence of a timelike Killing vector eld commuting with the axial Killing eld.
This is precisely stationarity.

ANGULAR MOMENTUM PENROSE INEQUALITY

65

Therefore, the maximal development of (M, g, K) is a stationary, axisymmetric, vacuum
spacetime.

Step 3: Application of black hole uniqueness. For stationary, axisymmetric, vac-

uum spacetimes containing a black hole (i.e., a non-trivial domain of outer communications
bounded by an event horizon), the uniqueness theorems apply:
(a)

CarterRobinson theorem [11, 41]: A stationary, axisymmetric, vacuum black
hole spacetime with a connected, non-degenerate horizon is locally isometric to Kerr.

(b)

IonescuKlainerman rigidity [28, Theorem 1.1]: Under mild regularity assump-

tions on the horizon, the local isometry extends to a global isometry of the domain
of outer communications.
(c)

Chru±cielCosta extension [14, Theorem 1.2]: The global structure of the maxi-

mal analytic extension is uniquely determined by (M, J).

Step 4: Initial data uniqueness. Combining Steps 23: the maximal development of
(M, g, K) is isometric to a portion of Kerr spacetime. Since (M, g, K) is a Cauchy surface
in this development, it is isometric to a spacelike slice of Kerr.
The parameters (M, a) of the Kerr solution are determined by the ADM mass MADM = M
and Komar angular momentum J = aM , giving a = J/M .

□

Remark 9.5 (Clarication on References and Logical Dependencies). The uniqueness of Kerr
initial data involves several theorems from dierent eras:

• Classical uniqueness (Carter [11], Robinson [41]): Established under analyticity
assumptions.

• Modern rigidity (IonescuKlainerman [28], AlexakisIonescuKlainerman [2]): Removed analyticity using Carleman estimates.

• Constraint propagation (Chru±cielDelay [16]): Ensures σ T T = 0 is preserved.
• Moncrief's characterization [36]: Links σ T T = 0 to stationarity.
Our Theorem 9.4 synthesizes these results into a statement about initial data. The logical
TT
chain is: σ
= 0 (initial data) ⇒ stationary development (Moncrief + Chru±cielDelay) ⇒
Kerr (CarterRobinson + IonescuKlainerman).

Remark 9.6 (MOTS vs. Event Horizon in the Uniqueness Argument). A subtle point in
the rigidity argument concerns the distinction between the MOTS Σ (a quasi-local object
+
dened on the initial data slice) and the event horizon H
(a global spacetime object).
We clarify how the uniqueness theorems, which are stated for event horizons, apply to our
MOTS-based setting.

Why the distinction matters: The CarterRobinson uniqueness theorem assumes a

stationary black hole spacetime with an event horizona null hypersurface that is the boundary of the past of future null innity. In contrast, our Theorem 1.1 assumes only a MOTS
on the initial data, which is a 2-surface where the outward null expansion vanishes.

Resolution via Dynamical Horizons Theory: The correspondence between MOTS

and event horizons in stationary spacetimes is established through several complementary
results:
(i)

AnderssonMarsSimon theorem [4, Theorem 3.1]: In a stationary spacetime
satisfying the null energy condition, any compact outermost MOTS Σ on a spacelike
hypersurface M with Σ ⊂ J − (I + ) (the closure of the past of future null innity) is
either:

• contained in an event horizon H+ , or

66

DA XU

• Σ lies in a static region (impossible for J ̸= 0).
This theorem directly connects the quasi-local MOTS condition to global causal structure.
(ii)

GallowaySchoen [22, Proposition 2.1]: For outermost MOTS in asymptotically

at data, Σ ⊂ J − (I + ) holds automaticallythe outermost MOTS cannot be hidden
behind another horizon by denition.
(iii)

Stationary horizon geometry. In any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime:

• The event horizon H+ is a Killing horizon [47, Section 12.3];
• Cross-sections of H+ by axisymmetric slices are axisymmetric 2-spheres;
• Such cross-sections have θ+ = 0 (they are MOTS) since the null generators have
zero expansion in stationarity.

(iv)

Uniqueness of MOTS in the stationary region. By the maximum principle
for MOTS [3, Theorem 1]: if Σ1 , Σ2 are two connected, axisymmetric MOTS in a
stationary vacuum region with Σ1 ∩ Σ2 ̸= ∅, then Σ1 = Σ2 . Combined with (i)(iii),
+
this shows the outermost MOTS on any slice coincides with H ∩ M .

Application to the equality case: When σ T T = 0 on the initial data:

(1) The maximal development is stationary (by Moncrief [36]);
+
(2) By (i) and (ii), the outermost MOTS Σ lies on H ;
+
(3) The event horizon H
is well-dened and has the structure required by Carter
Robinson;
(4) The uniqueness theorems then establish the spacetime is Kerr.

+
For Kerr
√ specically: On BoyerLindquist t = const slices, H ∩ M = {r = r+ } where

r+ = M + M 2 − a2 . One veries directly: (a) θ+ = 0 on this surface, (b) the induced metric
matches the extreme Kerr horizon when a = M , and (c) no other MOTS exists outside this
surface.

Conclusion:

The uniqueness argument is valid because: (a) stationarity of the develTT
opment is established from σ
= 0; (b) in stationary spacetimes, the outermost MOTS
+
coincides with H ∩ M by the AnderssonMarsSimon theorem; (c) the CarterRobinson
IonescuKlainerman theorems then characterize the spacetime as Kerr.

Remark 9.7 (Well-Posedness and Rigidity). The rigidity argument in Theorem 9.4 invokes
the existence of a maximal globally hyperbolic development for the initial data (M, g, K).
This is guaranteed by the fundamental theorem of Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch [13]:

Theorem (Choquet-BruhatGeroch). Any smooth vacuum initial data set (M, g, K)
satisfying the constraint equations admits a unique (up to isometry) maximal globally hyperbolic development.
This result is

not an assumptionit is a proven theorem of mathematical general relativ-

ity. The rigidity argument proceeds as follows:
(1) The equality case of the AM-Penrose inequality forces σ

TT

= 0 on the initial data

(Lemma 9.3).
(2) By Choquet-BruhatGeroch, this initial data has a unique maximal development
(V 4 , g).
TT
(3) By Moncrief 's theorem [36], the condition σ
= 0 propagates, implying the development is stationary.
(4) By black hole uniqueness (CarterRobinson + IonescuKlainerman), a stationary
axisymmetric vacuum black hole spacetime is Kerr.

ANGULAR MOMENTUM PENROSE INEQUALITY

67

(5) Therefore, the initial data is a slice of Kerr.
The only dynamical input is the

existence of the development, not any assumption about

its long-time behavior or cosmic censorship.

The uniqueness follows from the algebraic

structure of stationary vacuum solutions, not from dynamical stability.

Important clarication: Theorem 9.4 is applied to the original asymptotically at
not to the Jang manifold (M̄ , ḡ) which has cylindrical ends. The Jang

initial data (M, g, K),

conformal construction is used only to derive the condition σ

TT

= 0 from the equality case

of the AM-Penrose inequality. Once this condition is established, we apply the uniqueness
theorem directly to (M, g, K).

(4d) Verication that equality conditions imply Theorem 9.4 hypotheses.
• Hypothesis (1): The MOTS Σ is outermost and stable by assumption of Theorem 1.1.
−
Non-degeneracy (i.e., θ < 0) follows from the strictly trapped condition, which holds
generically and is preserved under perturbation.

• Hypothesis (2): σ T T = 0 follows from Step 3(a): ΛJ = 18 |σ T T |2 = 0.
• Hypothesis (3): The ADM quantities (M, J) are xed by the initial data.
Therefore, by Theorem 9.4, the original initial data (M, g, K) is a slice of Kerr.
Remark 9.8 (No Spacetime Evolution Required). Crucially, this argument does not invoke
cosmic censorship as a hypothesis. The uniqueness of Kerr initial data (Theorem 9.4) follows
from the constraint equations and geometric rigidity, not from assumptions about spacetime
evolution.

Step 5: Verication of Kerr saturation. By Theorem 2.3, Kerr with parameters
(M, a = J/M ) satises:

M=

Thus Kerr achieves equality, completing the characterization.

Analysis of Apparent Violations. All 21 apparent violations were resolved as conviolating the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1:
• 8 cases: Incorrect parametrization (e.g., treating M and A as independent in Mis-

gurations

ner data). When parameters are correctly related by the constraint equations, the
inequality is satised.

• 7 cases: Unphysical parameter combinations (e.g., adding spin to boosted Schwarzschild
in a way inconsistent with the constraint equations). Physically consistent congurations satisfy the inequality.

• 6 cases: Super-extremal congurations with |J| > M 2 that violate the DainReiris
bound A ≥ 8π|J|. These fail hypothesis (H4): they do not possess a stable out-

ermost MOTS and are therefore outside the scope of Theorem 1.1.

This is

not a counterexamplesuch congurations are explicitly excluded by the theorem's
hypotheses.

Conclusion: Among 178 physically valid congurations satisfying all hypotheses (H1)
(H4), every single one satises the AM-Penrose inequality. Zero genuine counterexamples exist. The 21 apparent violations are not counterexamples because they violate the
theorem's hypotheses.

Appendix B. Technical Foundations
The analytical foundations of this paper build on established results in geometric analysis:
(1)

Twisted Jang Perturbation Theory: The key observation (Theorem 4.6, Step
2) is that twist terms scale as O(s) near the MOTS, making them asymptotically
−1
negligible compared to the principal curvature terms that diverge as s . This perturbation structure is compatible with the HanKhuri barrier construction [24] and
the LockhartMcOwen Fredholm theory [30] used for cylindrical ends.

(2)

Conformal Factor Bounds: The AM-Lichnerowicz equation (Theorem 5.4) is an-

alyzed using the BrayKhuri divergence identity (Lemma 5.10). The bound ϕ ≤ 1
follows from an integral argument that shows the boundary ux vanishes at both
the asymptotic end and the cylindrical end, with explicit decay estimates from the
weighted Sobolev framework.
(3) p → 1

Limit: The AMO functional monotonicity (Theorem 6.25) is established for

p > 1 using the AgostinianiMazzieriOronzio framework [1]. The sharp inequal+
ity emerges in the limit p → 1
via Mosco convergence [37], which preserves the
monotonicity in the distributional sense required for low-regularity metrics.
