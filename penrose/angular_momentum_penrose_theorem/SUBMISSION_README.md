## Manuscript Summary

### Main Result (Theorem 1.1)
For asymptotically flat, axisymmetric, vacuum initial data $(M^3, g, K)$ with strictly stable MOTS $\Sigma$:

$$M_{\text{ADM}} \geq \sqrt{\frac{A}{16\pi} + \frac{4\pi J^2}{A}}$$

with equality iff the data is a Kerr slice.

### Key Innovations
1. **Jang--conformal--AMO method**: Four-stage proof combining Jang equation, conformal transformation, and p-harmonic flow
2. **AM-Hawking mass**: $m_{H,J}(t) = \sqrt{m_H^2(t) + 4\pi J^2/A(t)}$ is monotone
3. **J-conservation**: Angular momentum preserved via de Rham cohomology
4. **Complete rigidity**: Equality case fully characterized

### Paper Statistics
- Length: ~6,500 lines LaTeX (~120 pages)
- Theorems/Lemmas: 50+
- References: 60+
- Self-contained proofs with explicit estimates
