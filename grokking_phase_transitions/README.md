# The Geometry of Grokking and Phase Transitions

This repository contains the research paper "The Geometry of Grokking: Phase Transitions at the Edge of Stability".

## Abstract
We investigate the phenomenon of "grokking" in deep neural networks, proving geometric conditions under which it occurs. We characterize the "Edge of Stability" where the optimization process transitions from a memorization manifold to a generalization manifold using tools from dynamical systems and bifurcation theory.
