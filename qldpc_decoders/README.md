# Linear-Time Decoders for "Good" qLDPC Codes

## Domain
Quantum Error Correction (QEC) & Codes

## Context
A "good" quantum code is one where the number of logical qubits ($k$) and the code distance ($d$) both scale linearly with the number of physical qubits ($n$). For years, it was open if these even *existed*.

## Recent Breakthrough
In 2022/2023, "asymptotically good" quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (qLDPC) codes were finally constructed (the "quantum Tanner codes").

## Current Open Challenge
While we now know they *exist*, the race is on to construct practical, **linear-time decoders** for them. Recent work (2024) has proposed some, but optimizing their fault-tolerance thresholds remains a major mathematical engineering challenge.
