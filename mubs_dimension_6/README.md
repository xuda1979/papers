# Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) in Dimension 6

## Domain
Quantum Information & Foundations

## The Problem
Two bases are "mutually unbiased" if knowing the state perfectly in one basis gives you zero information about the state in the other. We know that in prime power dimensions (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8...), there are exactly $d+1$ such bases.

## The Specific Question
For $d=6$ (the smallest non-prime-power), can we find a complete set of 7 MUBs? The best we have found is 3.

## Status
**Open.** It is widely believed the answer is "No," but it remains unproven.
