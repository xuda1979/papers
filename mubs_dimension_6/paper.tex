\begin{abstract}
This paper explores the existence of Mutually Unbiased Bases in dimension 6, a significant open problem in Quantum Information and Foundations.
\end{abstract}

\section{Domain}
Quantum Information \& Foundations

\section{The Problem}
Two bases are "mutually unbiased" if knowing the state perfectly in one basis gives you zero information about the state in the other. We know that in prime power dimensions (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8...), there are exactly $d+1$ such bases.

\section{The Specific Question}
For $d=6$ (the smallest non-prime-power), can we find a complete set of 7 MUBs? The best we have found is 3.

\section{Status}
\textbf{Open.} It is widely believed the answer is "No," but it remains unproven.
