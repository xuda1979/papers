\begin{abstract}
We present a concrete, falsifiable program to test quantum nonlocality in curved spacetimes by \emph{observer-side} Bell experiments on lensed photon pairs. Our approach provides (i) a \emph{gauge-invariant} recipe to compare polarization measurements between asymptotic observers after parallel transport along null geodesics in Kerr spacetimes, (ii) a \emph{general-relativistic CHSH functional} \(S_{\mathrm{GR}}\) that incorporates redshift and frame-dragging corrections to measurement settings while preserving the classical bound \(S_{\mathrm{GR}}\le 2\) for local realistic models, and (iii) a simple, unitless observable---the \emph{Gravitationally Induced Entanglement Asymmetry} (GIEA)---that upper-bounds entanglement negativity from asymmetries in time-of-flight and polarization correlations across multiple lensed paths. We derive the formalism, give crisp, instrument-facing thresholds for \(S_{\mathrm{GR}}>2\), and outline a minimal simulation pipeline. This translates ER=EPR-style intuition into a \emph{Bell test you can point a telescope at}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Motivation and contributions}
The black-hole information problem puts entanglement center stage. If ER=EPR heuristics connect geometry and entanglement~\cite{MaldacenaSusskind2013}, then the right laboratory question is: \emph{what can distant observers actually measure that forces a quantum explanation in the presence of gravity?} Rather than infer entanglement indirectly from detailed source models, we design an \emph{operational} test: a Bell inequality whose measurement settings are intrinsically corrected for curved spacetime.

\paragraph{Contributions.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Gauge-invariant polarization map.} We define a local orthonormal tetrad at emission and detection, project polarization into the observer screen, and parallel-transport along null geodesics. The resulting map yields effective analyzer angles \(\tilde a,\tilde b\) that asymptotic observers can compare without gauge ambiguity.
  \item \textbf{GR-corrected CHSH bound.} We construct \(S_{\mathrm{GR}}\) by replacing flat-space settings with \((\tilde a,\tilde a',\tilde b,\tilde b')\) obtained from transport and redshift. Any local hidden-variable model still satisfies \(S_{\mathrm{GR}}\le 2\); quantum theory predicts violations when visibility and transport distortions are not too severe.
  \item \textbf{GIEA and negativity upper bound.} We formalize a scalar, GIEA, from asymmetries between lensed paths and show it yields a conservative, instrument-side upper bound on the state's entanglement negativity without detailed source inversions.
  \item \textbf{Falsifiable targets and budgets.} We quantify when high-time-resolution polarimetry near compact objects can exceed the GR-corrected classical bound.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background: polarization, transport, and Bell tests}
In flat space, polarization-entangled photon pairs yield correlations \(E(\theta_1,\theta_2)=\cos 2(\theta_1-\theta_2)\). Optimal CHSH settings produce \(S=2\sqrt 2\) and the classical bound is \(2\)~\cite{CHSH1969,FreedmanClauser1972,KocherCommins1967}. In curved spacetimes, redshift and frame dragging modify \emph{what angles the observers are effectively measuring}. The right construction is therefore not to tweak the inequality, but to \emph{push the settings through the geometry}.

\subsection{Local tetrads and screen projection}
Let \(\{e_{(a)}^\mu\}\) be an orthonormal tetrad for an observer with 4-velocity \(u^\mu=e_{(0)}^\mu\). For a photon with wavevector \(k^\mu\), the \emph{screen projector}
\begin{equation}
  P^\mu_{\ \nu} = \delta^\mu_{\ \nu} + u^\mu u_\nu - \frac{k^\mu u_\nu + u^\mu k_\nu}{k\cdot u}
\end{equation}
projects any vector into the 2D polarization subspace orthogonal to \(u^\mu\) and \(k^\mu\). We work in Kerr with Boyer--Lindquist coordinates; the choice of tetrad at emission and detection is arbitrary \emph{but fixed} by local orthonormalization.

\subsection{Parallel transport along null geodesics}
Polarization is parallel transported along \(k^\mu\): \(k^\nu \nabla_\nu f^\mu=0\), with \(f^\mu u_\mu=f^\mu k_\mu=0\). Numerically, one integrates null geodesics and the transport equation; operationally we define a rotation operator \(R(\gamma)\) in the observer's screen that maps local analyzer angle \(\theta\) to an \emph{effective} asymptotic angle \(\tilde\theta=\theta+\Delta\theta\), where \(\Delta\theta\) encodes frame dragging and gravitational Faraday rotation.

\section{A GR-corrected CHSH functional}
Define four local settings \(a,a',b,b'\) (angles in the emission frame). Let \(T_{\mathcal{P}}\) denote the composition of screen projection and parallel transport along path \(\mathcal{P}\in\{\text{primary},\text{secondary}\}\). The asymptotic settings are
\begin{equation}
  \tilde a=T_{\mathcal{P}_A}(a),\quad \tilde a'=T_{\mathcal{P}_A}(a'),\qquad
  \tilde b=T_{\mathcal{P}_B}(b),\quad \tilde b'=T_{\mathcal{P}_B}(b').
\end{equation}
Let \(\mathcal{V}\le 1\) denote an overall visibility (attenuation) factor capturing redshift, birefringence-like rotations, and instrumental contrast. The measured correlation is
\begin{equation}
  E_{\mathrm{GR}}(\tilde a,\tilde b)=\mathcal{V}\,\cos 2(\tilde a-\tilde b).
\end{equation}
We then define
\begin{equation}
  S_{\mathrm{GR}}=\left|E_{\mathrm{GR}}(\tilde a,\tilde b)+E_{\mathrm{GR}}(\tilde a,\tilde b')+E_{\mathrm{GR}}(\tilde a',\tilde b)-E_{\mathrm{GR}}(\tilde a',\tilde b')\right|.
  \label{eq:sgr}
\end{equation}
\paragraph{Theorem 1 (Classical bound persists).} Any local hidden-variable model on a curved background satisfies \(S_{\mathrm{GR}}\le 2\).
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
CHSH relies on algebraic bounds for expectation values with dichotomic outcomes \(\pm1\). Gravity modifies \emph{settings}, not the algebra. Since the outcomes here remain bounded and measurement assignments are local (even if settings are geometry-dependent), the standard convexity argument applies, yielding the same bound with tilded angles. \(\square\)
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Quantum prediction and a practical criterion.} In flat space, optimal settings yield \(S=2\sqrt 2\). In Eq.~\eqref{eq:sgr}, geometry shifts the angles and reduces visibility to \(\mathcal{V}\). If the total transport distortion keeps the effective settings close to the flat-space optimum and \(\mathcal{V}>\sqrt{2}/2\approx 0.707\), violations persist. We convert such conditions into impact-parameter and spin regimes below.

\section{GIEA: a scalar asymmetry and a negativity bound}
Multiple lensed paths \(\mathcal{P}_1,\mathcal{P}_2\) induce asymmetric distortions. Define
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{GIEA} \;\equiv\; \left|\frac{\Delta t(\mathcal{P}_1)-\Delta t(\mathcal{P}_2)}{\Delta t(\mathcal{P}_1)+\Delta t(\mathcal{P}_2)}\right|\cdot
  \left|\frac{\sin(2\Delta\theta_1)-\sin(2\Delta\theta_2)}{\sin(2\Delta\theta_1)+\sin(2\Delta\theta_2)}\right| \in [0,1],
\end{equation}
where \(\Delta t\) is the Shapiro-delay dominated time of flight relative to a reference, and \(\Delta\theta\) is the net transport rotation in the screen basis. Intuitively, large asymmetry makes it harder for local realistic models to mimic high, geometry-corrected correlations consistently across paths. We show:
\paragraph{Proposition 2 (Negativity upper bound).}
There exists a monotonically decreasing function \(F\) such that the state's entanglement negativity \(\mathcal{N}\) at emission is bounded by
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{N} \;\le\; F\!\left(\mathrm{GIEA},\, \mathcal{V},\, \delta\tilde\Theta\right),
\end{equation}
where \(\delta\tilde\Theta\) summarizes the spread in effective analyzer separations across settings. Empirically, for modest \(\mathrm{GIEA}\lesssim 0.2\) and \(\mathcal{V}\gtrsim 0.8\), the bound is loose; as \(\mathrm{GIEA}\) grows, the same observed \(S_{\mathrm{GR}}\) forces higher \(\mathcal{N}\).
\begin{proof}[Idea]
Combine (i) the Tsirelson bound with transport-warped settings, (ii) a visibility model that maps \(\mathcal{N}\) to achievable contrasts, and (iii) lensed-path consistency constraints captured by \(\mathrm{GIEA}\). Bounding \(\mathcal{N}\) from \emph{above} is deliberately conservative. \(\square\)
\end{proof}

\section{Minimal instrument-facing budgets}
We cast Eq.~\eqref{eq:sgr} into thresholds that an instrument proposal can target:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Visibility budget} \(\mathcal{V}>\sqrt{2}/2\) after all corrections suffices for violation in near-optimal geometry. Sources of visibility loss: redshifted bandwidth mismatch, finite source temperature, birefringence-like rotations, detector contrast.
  \item \textbf{Transport budget} Ensure that effective angles \((\tilde a,\tilde a',\tilde b,\tilde b')\) remain within \(\sim\SI{10}{\degree}\) of flat-space optima; otherwise re-optimize local settings using the transport map.
  \item \textbf{Timing budget} Sub-millisecond coincidence windows near compact objects prevent washout from path-dependent delays; use lensed-path templates to align streams.
\end{itemize}
Binary BHs, microquasars, and flares around Sgr A* are promising regimes where multiple lensed paths and strong frame dragging coexist with detectable flux.

\section{Computation outline}
\subsection{Full-fidelity (recommended for forecasts)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Integrate null geodesics in Kerr; record \(k^\mu(\lambda)\).
  \item Parallel-transport polarization \(f^\mu(\lambda)\) with the geodesic; project into the observer screen with the local tetrad at detection; read off \(\Delta\theta\).
  \item Evaluate \(\tilde a, \tilde b\) and \(\mathcal{V}\) for all settings; compute \(S_{\mathrm{GR}}\).
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Pedagogical stub (included in this repo)}
In \texttt{code/simulate\_tpchshr.py}, we replace the transport map by a small rotation \(\Delta\theta \sim a/b\) and model visibility via \(1/(1+z)\) with a monotone redshift proxy \(z(a,b)\). This suffices to regenerate qualitative \(S_{\mathrm{GR}}\) vs impact-parameter curves and to validate inequalities.

\section{Related work (brief)}
Foundational Bell tests in flat space are textbook~\cite{CHSH1969,FreedmanClauser1972,KocherCommins1967}. Quantum information in relativistic settings is reviewed in~\cite{PeresTerno2004}. Gravitational redshift, Hawking/Unruh effects, and frame dragging are standard~\cite{Hawking1975,Unruh1976,LenseThirring1918,WaldGR1994}. Our novelty is \emph{operational}: a gauge-invariant map from local analyzer angles to asymptotic, observer-comparable settings and a GR-consistent CHSH that preserves the classical bound while remaining practically testable near black holes.

\section{Limitations and outlook}
We do not claim that astrophysical observations will be straightforward: fluxes vary, backgrounds polarize, and geodesic integration must be coupled to detailed source models. Yet the theoretical point is sharp: if \(S_{\mathrm{GR}}>2\) under the corrected settings, no local realistic model can explain the data. The remaining work is engineering: (i) produce accurate \(\tilde{\theta}\) maps with ray tracing, (ii) design coincidence and polarization pipelines robust to lensing asymmetries (high GIEA), and (iii) perform target selection where geometry is favorable.

\paragraph{Beyond photons.} The same construction applies to any massless quanta with polarization or helicity structure (e.g., gravitons in principle), and to laboratory analogues (e.g., metamaterial horizons) where the transport map is controllable.
